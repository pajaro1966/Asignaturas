- ## Libro I

- ### 1.1-7

- Vs. 1-7. Prooemium: The wrath of Achilles, from its very beginning, and the destructive consequences which followed in accordance with the will of Zeus. This is the principal theme of the Iliad. The First Book serves as an introduction to the whole poem; it narrates the story of the strife between Achilles and Agamemnon, and the decree of Zeus, which is made on the intercession of Thetis. — The events narrated in A occupy 21 days.

- μῆνιν: wrath, lasting anger, the “memorem iram” of Verg. Aen. i. 4; cf. vs. 81, 247, 488. This receives prominence as being most important for the subject of the poem.

- θεά: cf. “ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε μοῦσα α” 1; see on 2.484. For the following caesural pause, see § 40 c.

- Πηληιάδεω: for the patronymic, see § 21 d; for the synizesis, see § 7.

- Ἀχιλῆος: for the single “λ”, see § 41 f“η”. Achilles was the son of Peleus and the sea-goddess Thetis (see vs. 351 ff.). He was the mightiest warrior of the Greek leaders before Troy (v. 280, 2.769), although one of the youngest (9.438 ff.). His home was in Phthia (2.681 ff.) of Thessaly. See on v. 488.

- [**2**] οὐλομένην: destructive, deadly; cf. Milton Par. Lost i. 2 “forbidden fruit . . .

- whose mortal taste

- Brought death into the world.

- ” The thought is amplified in the following rel. clause, cf. v. 10, 2.227; see § 1 h, t.

- μυρία: countless; not a numeral in Homer, see § 23 i. — For the hiatus, allowed when the final vowel has been elided, see § 9 e.

- ἄλγεα: i.e. the defeats caused by the absence of Achilles from the conflict.

- ἔθηκεν: caused (as 3.321, see § 2 v), nearly equiv. to “τεῦχε” below.

- [**3**] πολλάς: the second clause of the rel. sent. is closely connected with the first by the anaphoric relation of “πολλάς” to “μυρία” (cf. Od. 1.1-3); while the third clause is added in the form of a contrast, “αὐτοὺς δὲ κτλ.”

- ἰφθίμους: the fem. form “ἰφθίμας” is used by Homer only of persons; see § 20 a.

- Ἄϊδι προΐαψεν: sent off to Hades, a vigorous expression for a violent death, as “Ε 190, Ζ 487, Λ” 55; cf. “Ἀίδᾳ προϊάψαι δορὸς ἄγραν” Aesch. Sept. 309, “multos Danaum demittimus Orco” Verg. Aen. ii. 398. For the use of “πρό”, cf. “πρὸ ἧκε” v. 195.

- Ἄϊδι: a metaplastic form of “Ἀίδης” (§ 19 f.), which in Homer is always the name of a person, the ruler of the nether world (§ 2 v.).

- [**4**] ἡρώων: did not have the later meaning of heroes in the Eng. sense (§ 2 v).

- αὐτούς: themselves, i.e. their bodies as contrasted with their souls, as “Ψ 66, ζ 329, λ” 574, 602. They would have cared less about the rites of burial, if they had not considered the body to be the man himself.

- ἑλώρια: booty, cf. “κυσὶν δ̓ ἔπειθ̓ ἕλωρα κἀπιχωρίοις ι ὄρνισι δεῖπνον” Aesch. Supp. 808 f., “canibus date praeda Latinis \| alitibusque” Verg. Aen. ix. 485 f. For the preceding hiatus, see § 9 b.

- τεῦχε κύνεσσιν: since the bodies often had to lie unburied, cf. “Β 393, Θ 491, Λ 395, Σ 271, 283, Χ” 66 ff., 339. Dogs are the scavengers of the East. cf. ‘Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat’ 1 Kings xxi. 24, ‘And the Philistine said to David, “Come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field”’ 1 Sam. xvii. 44. To be left unburied was a dreaded fate; so Hector at the point of death besought Achilles, “μή με ἔα παρὰ νηυσὶ κύνας καταδάψαι Ἀχαιῶν Χ” 339.

- τεῦχε: for the omission of the aug., see § 25 a, e.

- [**5**] δαῖτα: of the food of brutes, as 24.43; cf. 2.383.

- Διὸς . . . βουλή: instead of “Διὸς μεγάλου διὰ βουλάς”, as Od. 8.82, is joined paratactically (§ 3 n f.) to the preceding rel. clause; the will of Zeus was accomplished in the consequences of the wrath of Achilles. cf. ‘Such was the will of heaven’ Milton Par. Lost ii. 1025.

- ἐτελείετο: for the form, see on 2.536, § 29 i.

- [**6**] ἐξ οὗ κτλ.: since first, since once; the starting-point for “μῆνιν οὐλομένην”. This expression takes the place in Homer of the prose “ἐπεὶ ἅπαξ, ἐπεὶ τάχιστα”, cf. v. 235, “ἐπεὶ δὴ τὸ πρῶτον δ” 13. “πρῶτον” and “πρῶτα” are used adv. with little difference of meaning, cf. vs. 276, 319.

- τά: for the short vowel lengthened before the following consonants, see § 41 h.

- διαστήτην ἐρίσαντε: were divided (lit. separated) in strife.

- [**7**] Ἀτρεΐδης: tetrasyllabic, § 21 f.; for the use of the patronymic, see § 21 b. Agamemnon, son of Atreus, and grandson of Pelops (2.104 ff.), reigned at Mycenae (2.569 ff.). As the leader of the expedition against Troy, he is prominent through the whole poem. The first part of the Eleventh Book is devoted to his brave deeds in war (“Ἀγαμέμνονος ἀριστεία”). He is described by Helen as ‘a good king and a brave warrior’ (3.179).

- ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν: elsewhere precedes a proper name; only here is it found after a patronymic. It is generally applied to Agamemnon, § 1 q. For the apparent hiatus, see §§ 9 f, 14 a.

- δῖος: godlike, glorious (“εὺγενής”), a standing epith. of Achilles and of Odysseus. No special excellence of character is implied. Obs. the metrical adaptation to the names of these two heroes, allowing the bucolic diaeresis, at the close of the verse, see § 40 i; cf. “Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων, Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς” closes the verse more than 50 times; “δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς”, more than 100 times.

- [**8**] Vs. 8-52. The injured Chryses. The avenging Apollo. The scene opens in the 9th year of the war before Troy (2.295). During their siege of the city, the Greeks supported themselves by marauding expeditions. On one of these forays they captured Thebe (vs. 366 ff.) and brought away as part of the booty the daughter of Chryses, priest of Apollo (v. 370). She was assigned to Agamemnon, to be his slave, as his “γέρας”, prize of honor. See on vs. 124 f.

- τίς τ̓ ἄρ: and who then? question from the standpoint of the hearer, suggested by v. 6. cf. ‘Who first seduced them to that foul revolt? — Th' infernal serpent’ Milton Par. Lost i. 33. Some god must have decreed the calamity; the Homeric theology recognized no blind chance.

- ἔριδι ξυνέηκε: brought together in strife, cf. “θεῶν ἔριδι ξυνιόντων γ” 66 as the gods came together in strife, “θεοὺς ἔριδι ξυνελάσσαι γ” 134.

- ξυνέηκε: for the augment, see § 25 h.

- μάχεσθαι: sc. “ἐπέεσσιν”, cf. v. 304, 2.377 f. Inf. of result, where “ὥστε” might have been used in prose, cf. “μαντεύεσθαι” v. 107, “ἄγειν” v. 338, “ἀνάσσειν Β 108, ἐριζέμεναι Β” 214. Some of these examples may be taken as infs. of purpose, which cannot always be clearly separated from the inf. of result in Homer.

- [**9**] Λητοῦς: cf. v. 36. Apollo was the mediate cause of the trouble, since the pestilence occasioned the quarrel.

- ὁ: for the dem. use of the art., see § 24 i.

- βασιλῆι: Agamemnon, “ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν”.

- χολωθείς: see on v. 18.

- [**10**] νοῦσον: Att. “νόσον”, § 5 e; it is called “λοιμός” v. 61.

- ἀνὰ στρατόν: up through the camp (cf. “κατὰ στρατόν” v. 318), as the plague spread from tent to tent; cf. v. 53.

- κακήν: the adj. is explained by the following (paratactic consecutive) clause, the first word of which takes up the thought of the adj. For the order of words, connecting “κακήν” with what follows, see § 1 h.

- λαοί: soldiery, cf. 3.186 and Agamemnon's epith. “ποιμὴν λαῶν, Β” 243, shepherd of the people.

- [**11**] τὸν Χρύσην: that Chryses, well known to the hearers from stories or other songs. Nowhere else in Homer is the art. used with a proper name; cf. 2.595.

- ἠτίμασεν: slighted.

- ἀρητῆρα: receives prominence from its rhythm and position, almost equiv. to “though he was” etc. He is called “ἱερεύς” below.

- [**12**] θοάς: cf. “νηυσὶ ὠκυπόροισιν” v. 421; a standing epith. of the ships even when they were on shore, § 1 p.

- ἐπὶ νῆας: i.e. to the camp, where the ships were drawn up on land, cf. 2.688. — For the position of the prep. between the adj. and noun, cf. v. 15; see § 1 l.

- [**13**] λυσόμενος: to release for himself, to ransom. The act. is used of him who receives the ransom, vs. 20, 29.

- θύγατρα: Homer knows her only by her patronymic “Χρυσηίς” (v. 111, see § 21 g) daughter of Chryses.

- φέρων: bringing with him, prob. on a wagon. cf. 24.275 ff., 502.

- ἀπερείσἰ ἄποινα: bullion, either of gold, silver, or copper, as “Ζ 48, Χ” 340; or vessels of precious metal, as 23.741 ff.; or clothing, as 24.229 ff.

- [**14**] στέμματ̓ Ἀπόλλωνος: cf. Apollinis infula Verg. Aen. ii. 430. This ribbon, or chaplet, of white wool, marked the priest's official character; he came under the god's protection, but as a suppliant carried the fillet, instead of wearing it. cf. laurumque manu vittasque ferentem Chrysen Ovid Ars Am. ii. 401.

- ἑκηβόλου: he was the Archer Apollo. For similar epiths., see § 4 c. — For the loss of quantity in the final diphthoug before an initial vowel, cf. v. 17; see § 41 o.

- Ἀπόλλωνος: for the length of the first syllable, as vs. 21, 36, etc., see § 41 f.

- [**15**] χρυσέῳ: it was adorned with golden studs, see on v. 219, 2.45; cf. v. 246. So the soul of the seer Teiresias had a “χρύσεον σκῆπτρον” in Hades, Od. 11.91. — For the synizesis, see § 7.

- ἀνὰ σκήπτρῳ: on a staff; const. with “στέμματ̓ ἔχων”. Princes, judges, priests, and heralds carried “σκῆπτρα” as symbols of authority. A “σκῆπτρον” was placed in the hands of him who was about to address the assembly, as a sign that he “had the floor,” cf. v. 245, “Γ 218, στῆ δὲ μέσῃ ἀγορῇ: σκῆπτρον δέ οἱ ἔμβαλε χειρὶι κῆρυξ β” 37 f. The Spartans also carried stout staffs, and Athenian gentlemen carried canes.

- πάντας: the bard's hearers easily made for themselves the necessary limitations for such general expressions.

- [**16**] Ἀτρεΐδα δύω: for “δύω” with the dual, cf. “Αἴαντε δύω Β 406, Γ 18, λέοντε δύω, Ε” 554. This dual form is infrequent. Menelaus, king of Sparta (2.586), as husband of Helen, is associated with his brother Agamemnon; cf. “Β 408, Κ” 25 ff., “Ἀχαιῶν δίθρονον κράτος” Aesch. Ag. 108, “δικρατεῖς Ἀτρεῖδαι” Soph. Aj. 252.

- κοσμήτορε: “κοσμέω” is used in the sense of the later “τάσσω”, cf. “Β 554, Γ” 1, § 2 v.

- [**17**] 17 = 23.272, 658; cf. “Η 327, 385, Ψ” 236, — The usual introduction to a speech (§ 1 w) is omitted. — For the use of the speaker's very words, instead of indir. disc., see § 1 c.

- ἐυκνήμιδες: a standing epith. of the Achaeans (§ 1 q); in historical times, Herodotus (vii. 92) mentions greaves as worn by the Lycians in the army of Xerxes.

- [**18**] θεοί: monosyllable by synizesis, see § 7 a, d. — Cf. di tibi dent capta classem deducere Troia Hor. Sat. ii. 3. 191.

- [**19**] πόλιν: for the length of the ultima, see § 41 p.

- οἴκαδε: homeward, always of the return to Greece, not like “οἰκόνδε” into the house; see § 15 g.

- [**20**] παῖδα δέ: made prominent because of his love for his daughter; instead of the “ἐμοὶ δέ” which is expected in contrast with “ὑμῖν μέν” v. 18.

- λῦσαι: corresponds to “δοῖεν”. “As I pray that you may be victorious and have a safe return, so may ye restore to me” etc.; cf. the prayer of Priam for Achilles, “σὺ δὲ τῶνδ̓ ἀπόναιο, καὶ ἔλθοις ι σὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν Ω” 556 f., where the return of Hector's body is the condition implied for the prayer. The inf. is used for the opt., as Od. 7.313; cf. the inf. and imv. in parallel clauses, vs. 322 f., 3.459.

- τά τ̓ ἄποινα: he points to the gifts which he brought with him.

- [**21**] “ἁζόμενοι κτλ”.: a prime motive for granting the request; the Achaeans were to honor the god in the person of his priest. For the apparently neglected “Ϝ” of “ἑκηβόλον”, see § 14 e. The spondee in the fifth foot (see § 39 h f.) gives an emphatic close to the sentence, cf. vs. 11, 157, 291, 600.

- [**22**] The first hemistich = “α 11, β” 82.

- ἐπευφήμησαν: for the usual “ἐπῄνησαν” (7.344), because of the religious fear which was required by the priest. It is followed by the inf. as being equiv. to “ἐκέλευσαν ἐπευφημοῦντες” they bade with pious reverence; cf. “Β 290, οὐκ ἐλεαίρεις ἄνδρας” . . .

- “μισγέμεναι κακότητι υ” 202 f. “thou dost not in pity hinder men from suffering misery.” The sacral meaning of “εὐφημέω” favere linguis seems to be later than Homer.

- [**23**] αἰδεῖσθαι: repeats “ἁζόμενοι”.

- ἀγλαά: important epith., introducing a motive for the action.

- δέχθαι: 2 aor. inf. from “δέχομαι”, see § 35.

- [**24**] “ἀλλ̓ οὐκ κτλ”.: a sharp contrast to “ἄλλοι μέν”, giving prominence to the neg.; but not to the son of Atreus.

- θυμῷ: local, in heart; see § 1 v.

- [**25**] κακῶς: harshly; cf. the use of “κακήν” v. 10.

- ἀφίει: for the form, as from a verb in -“έω”, see § 34 a; for the omission of the aug., see § 25 a. Homer is fond of using the impf. to describe an action as in progress (see § 3 j), cf. “τεῦχε” v. 4.

- κρατερόν: strong, stern.

- ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλεν: laid upon him his command.

- ἐπί: const. with “ἔτελλεν”, §37 a, b.

- μῦθον: had not yet received the idea of fiction which is contained in the Eng. myth. “λόγος” is found but twice in Homer.

- 26-32. Agamemnon first rejects the admonition to fear the god and then refuses the request itself.

- [**26**] “μὴ κτλ”.: see to it that I do not, let me not, etc. This prohibitive use of “μή” with the 1 pers. sing. is very rare.

- κιχείω: “κιχῶ”, 2 aor. subjv. from “κιχάνω”, § 34 d.

- [**27**] αὖτις ἰόντα: returning, cf. “πάλιν πλαγχθέντας” v. 59, “δόμεναι πάλιν” v. 116.

- [**28**] “μή νύ τοι κτλ”.: lest perhaps etc., adds to the preceding command the result that was to be feared if the command were disregarded, cf. “Γ 414, Ω” 568 f.

- οὐ χραίσμῃ: “οὐ” is used, not “μή”, since the neg. and the verb form but one idea, be useless, of no avail; cf. v. 566, 3.289. — “σκῆπτρον κτλ”.: “thy priestly dignity.”

- [**29**] πρίν: sooner, adv. with “ἔπεισιν”, as “Σ 283, γ” 117; with strengthening “καί” even, as “Ω 551, λ” 330; almost much rather. — For the animated adversative asyndeton, see § 2 m.

- ἔπεισιν: shall come upon.

- [**30**] ἡμετέρῳ: the familiar our of the household.

- ἐν Ἄργεϊ: i.e. in Peloponnesus (which name is not found in Homer), “Ἄργος Ἀχαιικόν”, not “Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος” (Thessaly, 2.681), nor the city “Ἄργος” where Diomed ruled (2.559). In “Ζ 456, Ἄργος” seems to stand for all Greece, as “Ἀργεῖοι” is interchangeable with “Ἀχαιοί”, cf. v. 79.

- [**31**] ἱστὸν ἐποιχομένην: going to and fro before the loom, plying the loom; the Greek women stood as they wove at their upright looms. Weaving was the principal occupation of the female slaves.

- λέχος: acc. of limit of motion, only here with “ἀντιάω”, approach, share the couch; cf. “ἐπεὶ τὸ σὸν λέχος συνῆλθον” Soph. Aj. 491.

- [**32**] ἴθι, ἐρέθιζε: for the explanatory asyndeton, see § 2 m f.

- σαώτερος: more safely, sc. than if thou shouldst refuse to go. This independent use of the comp. is freq. in Homer.

- ὡς: in order that, here follows the emphatic word (§ 1 k); so “ὅτι, ὅ, ὔφρα”, and “ἵνα” may have the second place in the clause; cf. 2.125. — For “κέ” with the subjv., see G. 216, 1 N. 2; H. 882.

- [**32]

- [**33**] 33 = 24.571, cf. v. 568, “Γ 418, Κ 240, Ω” 689.

- ἔδεισεν: “fear came upon him.” For the quantity of the antepenult, cf. vs. 406, 568, 3.418; see § 41 j “β”, l “β. — ὁ γέρων: ὁ γεραιός” v. 35.

- [**34**] βῆ: set out, cf. 2.183. For the accent, cf. “φῆ Β” 37; see § 25 b.

- ἀκέων: in terror at the harsh words. The fem. “ἀκέουσα” is found v. 565, but “ἀκέων” is generally indeclinable.

- [**35**] πολλά: earnestly, cognate acc. used as adv. with “ἠρᾶτο”, see § 38 b, and on v. 78.

- ἀπάνευθε κιών: i.e. as he left the Achaean camp.

- [**36**] τόν: rel. pron., see § 24 l.

- [**37**] f. ἀργυρότοξε: the use of the epith. instead of the name gives a touch of intimacy to the address, as “γλαυκῶπι ν” 389 addressed to Athena by Odysseus; Athena addresses Apollo as “ἑκάεργε Η” 34 (cf. v. 110). — The gods' instruments are of precious metal even where the metal is not best adapted to the work, cf. “Ε 724, 731, Ω” 341, and on v. 611.

- Χρύσην, Κίλλαν: Mysian cities, seats of the worship of Apollo, on the gulf of Adramyttium. They disappeared before the classical period. Cilla is mentioned also Hdt. i. 149. Chrysa was the home of the priest, who received his name from it.

- ἀμφιβέβηκας: “dost guard.” The figure is taken from a beast standing over its young to protect it, cf. “Ε 299, ἀμφὶ δ̓ ἄῤ αὐτῷ βαῖν̓, ὥς τις περὶ πόρτακι μήτηρ Ρ 4, ὡς δὲ κύων . . . περὶ σκυλάκεσσι” (whelps) “βεβῶσα ι … ὑλάει” (barks) “μέμονέν τε μάχεσθαι υ” 14 f. cf. Gradivumque patrem Geticis qui praesidet arvis Verg. Aen. iii. 35.

- [**38**] Τενέδοιο: cf. est in conspectu Tenedos, notissima fama

- insula, dives opum, Priami dum regna manebant Verg. Aen. ii. 21 f.

- ἀνάσσεις: in its original meaning, art protecting lord. “βασιλεύω” is not used of the gods in Homer.

- [**39**] Σμινθεῦ: “Σμινθεύς” is a short, familiar form (§ 21 e) for “Σμινθοφθόρος”, epith. of Apollo as the averter of the plague of field mice.

- εἴ ποτε: if ever, a form of adjuration.

- χαρίεντα: proleptic, to thy pleasure, lit. as a pleasing one.

- ἐπὶ ἔρεψα: roofed over, i.e. completed, built. The suppliant believes that he has made the god his debtor by his services, and he claims favors in return; cf. vs. 503 f., 8.238 ff., “Ο 372, δ” 763. The gods themselves recognized this obligation, “Χ 170, Ω” 68; in Od. 1.60 f. Athena reproaches Zeus for his neglect of Odysseus in spite of the latter's burnt offerings.

- νηόν: Homer follows the so-called Attic second declension in but a few words, § 17 f.

- [**40**] δή: nearly equiv. to “ἤδη”.

- κατά: const. with “ἔκηα. — πίονα”: as covered with fat, cf. v. 460.

- μηρία: these and the synonymous “μῆρα” are the thigh pieces, with more or less flesh, as cut from the “μηροί” (v. 460) thighs of the victims, and sacrificed to the gods as burnt offerings. For the details of a sacrifice, see vs. 458 ff., 2.421 ff.

- [**41**] “τόδε μοι κτλ”.: a formula, after which ‘this desire’ is expressed by the opt., as here; by the imv., as vs. 456, 505, 8.243; by “ὡς” with the opt., as Od. 17.243; cf. “Ζεῦ πάτερ, αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο τελευτήσειας ἐέλδωρ:

- ὡς ἔλθοι μὲν κεῖνος ἀνήρ, ἀγάγοι δέ ἑ δαίμων φ

- ” 200 f.

- κρήηνον: imv. from “κραιαίνω”.

- [**42**] τίσειαν: the verb is placed first, as containing the sum of his desire.

- Δαναοί: used only of the Greek army in the Trojan war. But in the Iliad the poet uses “Ἀχαιοί” (the most frequently recurring designation of the Greeks), “Ἀργεῖοι” or “Δαναοί”, to suit the convenience of his verse; see on v. 79, § 4 b.

- 43 = v. 457, 16.527.

- ὡς . . . ἔκλυε: as “Ε 121, Π 249, Ψ 771, Ω 314, γ 385, ζ 328, ι 536, υ” 102.

- [**44**] βῆ . . . καρήνων: as “Β 167, Δ 74, Η 19, Χ 187, Ω 121, α 102, ω” 488.

- βῆ: set out; the motion is continued in “ὁ δ̓ ἤιε” v. 47.

- Οὐλύμποιο: Olympus in Homer is always the Thessalian mountain as home of the gods (not heaven itself) as is indicated by its epiths., “ἀγάννιφος” v. 420 snow-capped, “νιφόεις Σ 616, μακρός” v. 402, “πολυδειράς” v. 499, “πολύπτυχος Θ” 411; while “οὐρανός” is “ἀστερόεις Δ 44, εὐρύς Γ 364, μέγας Ε 750, πολύχαλκος Ε 504, σιδήρεος ο 329, χάλκεος Ρ” 425. cf. on v. 195. But see

- “ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη

- Οὐλυμπόνδ̓ ὅθι φασὶ θεῶν ἕδος ἀσφαλὲς αἰεὶ

- ἔμμεναι. οὔτ̓ ἀνέμοισι τινάσσεται … οὔτε χιὼν ἐπιπίλναται

- ”

- Od. 6.41 ff.

- καρήνων: const. with “κατά”. For its use for the summits of mountains, cf. “Β 167, 869. — κῆρ”: acc. of specification, as “ἦτορ, θυμόν, φρένα”, all freq. with verbs of emotion (§ 1 v).

- [**45**] ὤμοισιν: dat. of place, see § 3 d.

- ἀμφηρεφέα: i.e. closed both above and below as it hung on the shoulder, see on 2.389. The explanation of the lengthened ultima is uncertain. Apollo as god of the bow always carries bow and quiver, cf. his words “σύνηθες ἀεὶ ταῦτα βαστάζειν ἐμοί” Eur. Alc. 40; so he is represented in works of art.

- [**46**] ἔκλαγξαν: seems to represent to the ear the sound of the bow and string, cf. “λίγξε βιός Δ” 125. cf. tela sonant humeris Verg. Aen. iv. 149.

- [**47**] “αὐτοῦ κινηθέντος: αὐτοῦ” contrasts the god with his arrows (§§ 1 h, 24 g). For the gen. abs., see § 3 f.

- νυκτί: a time of dread, cf. “ἔσθορε φαίδιμος Ἕκτωρ ι νυκτὶ θοῆ ἀτάλαντος ὑπώπια Μ” 462 f., “λ 606, υ” 362, ‘He on his impious foes right onward drove,

- Gloomy as night’ Milton Par. Lost vi. 831 f. Comparisons are a notable characteristic of Homer's style. They are less frequent in this First Book of the Iliad than elsewhere. cf. v. 359, 2.87 ff., 146 ff., 337 ff., 394 ff., 455-483. See § 2 e ff.

- [**48**] μετά: into the midst of the camp.

- ἰόν: an arrow.

- [**49**] δεινή: attrib. with “κλαγγή”. cf. horrendum stridens sagitta Verg. Aen. ix. 632.

- ἀργούς: swift, cf. “τῶν ἀρχαίων ἀργὸν τὸ ταχὺ προσαγορευόντων” Diod. iv. 42.

- [**51**] αὐτάρ: stronger than “δέ”, correl. with “μέν” v. 50. See on “αὖ Β” 768, § 3 r.

- αὐτοῖσι: the Greeks themselves, contrasted with their domestic animals; more emphatic than “βροτοῖσι”.

- ἐφιείς: iterative in meaning, like “βάλλε” following.

- [**52**] βάλλε: shot, with emphatic position at the close of a sent. and beginning of a verse; cf. vs. 143 f., 241, 296, 501, 506, 523, 526, Od. 9.196.

- πυραί: pl. since a new pyre was built each day.

- ἐννῆμαρ: ἐννέα is a round number in Homer, as “Ζ 174, Μ 25, Ω 107, 610, 664, 784, η 253, ι 82, κ 28, μ 447, ξ” 314. cf. ‘Nine times the space that measures day and night \| To mortal men’ Milton Par. Lost i. 50.

- ᾤχετο: the arrows are personified, cf. “ἆλτο δ̓ ὀιστὸς ι ὀξυβελής, καθ᾽ ὅμιλον ἐπιπτέσθαι μενεαίνων” 4.125 f. eager to fly into the throng, “Λ 574, Φ” 70.

- [**54**] τῇ δεκάτῃ: the art. calls attention to this as the decisive day. The adj. agrees with “ἡμέρῃ” or “ἠοῖ” implied in “ἐννῆμαρ.” cf. the omission of “χειρί” v. 501, “βουλήν Β 379, δοράν Γ 16, χλαῖναν Γ 126, πυλέων Γ” 263; and the use of neut. adjs. as substs., see on v. 539.

- δέ: may stand after the second word in the clause since the first two words are so closely connected.

- ἀγορήνδε: The agora of the Achaeans was at the centre of their camp, a little removed from the sea, by the ships of Odysseus; cf. 8.222 f., with 11.806 f., 2.208. The “ἀγορή” in Homer was not yet degraded to the name of market place, see § 2 v; it corresponds to the meeting place of the Athenian “ἐκκλησία”.

- καλέσσατο: caused to be summoned, cf. 2.50. Other princes than the commander-in-chief had authority to call an assembly of the people.

- [**55**] τῷ: equiv. to Att. “αὐτῷ”, lit. for him.

- ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε: put into (lit. upon) his heart, as 8.218. The Homeric Greeks did not think of the head as the seat of the intellect.

- λευκώλενος: freq. epith. of Hera (§ 1 q), not often of women, as 3.121; cf. “βοῶπις” v. 551.

- [**56**] ῥά: you see, with reference to the scene depicted in vs. 51 f.

- ὁρᾶτο: the act. and mid. forms, “ὁρῶ” and “ὁρῶμαι, εῖδον” and “ἰδόμην, ἴδω” and “ἴδωμαι”, are used in Homer without appreciable difference of meaning (§ 32 a); cf. vs. 203, 262, 587, “Β 237, Γ” 163.

- 57 = “Ω 790, β 9, θ 24, ω” 421. — “ἤγερθεν κτλ”.: the two verbs are thought to express the beginning and the completion of the act; but we may compare the ‘assemble and meet together’ of the Prayer Book. For the fulness of expression, see § 1 s.

- ἤγερθεν: aor. pass. from “ἀγείρω”. For the form, see § 26 v.

- [**58**] δέ: for its use in the apodosis, see § 3 n; cf. vs. 137, 194, 280, 3.290.

- ἄμμε: Aeolic form for “ἡμᾶς” (§ 24 a).

- πάλιν πλαγχθέντας: driven back, i.e. unsuccessful, without having taken Ilios. cf. 2.132.

- [**60**] εἴ κεν φύγοιμεν: the opt. is used instead of the subjv., because escape is thought of only vaguely.

- θάνατόν γε: contrasted with “ἀπονοστήσειν”. “If indeed we may expect to return, and are not rather to die here.”

- [**61**] εἰ δή: if now, as seems likely.

- δαμᾷ: fut., see § 30 b.

- [**62**] ἄγε: has become a mere interjection, and is used with the pl., as “Β 331, Γ” 441; but “ἄγετε” also is used, as 2.72, 83.

- μάντιν: a soothsayer, augur, who foretold the future chiefly from the flight of birds.

- ἔρειομεν: let us ask; 2d aor. subjv., as if from “ἔρημι” (§ 34 d).

- ἱερῆα: a priest of a definite divinity and sanctuary who predicted from the observation of sacrifices, cf. “θυοσκόος χ” 318. Here some Trojan priest seems to be meant, since a priest could not desert the sanctuary of which he had charge, and so there were no priests in the Greek camp before Troy. The kings performed the sacrifices and offered prayers for the army; cf. 2.411 ff., 3.275 ff.

- [**63**] ὀνειροπόλον: dream-seer. A dream-oracle is described by Vergil, Aen. vii. 86-91. — “καὶ γὰρ κτλ”.: for a dream also, as well as other signs.

- γάρ τε: closely connected, like namque.

- ἐκ Διός: Zeus sends to Agamemnon (2.6) a dream that calls itself “Διὸς ἄγγελος”. Athena also sends a dream to Penelope (Od. 4.795).

- [**64**] ὅς κ̓ εἴποι: potential opt. in final sense, since the end aimed at is considered as a possible result of the principal action (“ἐρείομεν”), cf. “Η 342, Ω” 149.

- ὅτι: wherefore.

- τόσσον ἐχώσατο: conceived such heavy anger; inceptive aor.

- τόσσον: for the doubled “ς”, see § 12 a.

- Ἀπόλλων: Achilles assumes that the pestilence was sent by the god of health and disease.

- ὅ γε: for the repetition of the subj., see on v. 97.

- εὐχωλῆς, ἑκατόμβης: because of an unfulfilled vow or a hecatomb which has not been offered, cf. “ἱρῶν μηνίσας Ε” 178 angry on account of the omission of sacrifices, “μισθοῦ χωόμενοι, τὸν ὑποστὰς οὐκ ἐτέλεσσεν Φ” 457. — For the gen. of cause, cf. v. 429, “Β 225, 689, 694, τῆσδ̓ ἀπάτης κοτέων Δ” 168. — Homer does not hold strictly to the original meaning of hecatomb, cf. v. 315; a hecatomb of 12 heifers is mentioned 6.93, 115, and one of rams in 4.102.

- [**66**] “αἴ κεν κτλ”.: if perchance, in the hope that, he may please. H. 907.

- ἀρνῶν: part. gen.

- ἄρα: here refers to the partic., like “εἶτα” in prose, as “Β 310, α” 441.

- τοῖσι: dat. of interest, for them, see § 3 g; cf. vs. 247, 450, 571.

- [**69**] οἰωνοπόλων: soothsayers, in a general sense, as “οἰωνός” is used for omen. This expression is used of Priam's son Helenus, 6.76, and Calchas is “θεοπρόπος οἰωνιστής Ν” 70. He was a warrior as well as a seer; see on 2.832.

- ὄχα: used only as a strengthening prefix with forms of “ἄριστος. ἔξοχα” pre-eminent is more common.

- [**70**] ὅς: long by position, since “ᾔδη” once began with vau, cf. 2.38; see § 41 q. — “ᾔδη”: for the Homeric forms of “οἶδα”, see § 34 k. — This verse describes the seer's power in its full extent, cf. novit namque omnia vates

- quae sint, quae fuerint, quae mox ventura trahantur Verg. Georg. iv. 392 f.; 3.109.

- πρό τ̓ ἐόντα: and which were before, i.e. past.

- ἐόντα: forms of “εἰμί” in Homer regularly retain the “ε” of the stem (§ 34 g).

- [**71**] ἡγήσατο: he led the way, guided; here metaphorically of the seer who interpreted the portents relating to the voyage; cf. 2.322 f. So on the Argonautic expedition, the seer Mopsus gave the word for setting out. No expedition was complete without a soothsayer, even in the time of the Persian war, cf. Hdt. ix. 37.

- Ἴλιον εἴσω: concludes the verse, as “Ρ 159, 163, Σ 58, 439, Ω 145, τ” 182, 193.

- Ἴλιον: here like “Τροίη”, of the kingdom of Priam, not the city itself.

- εἴσω: only with verbs of motion; much like “εἰς”. It follows its acc.

- [**72**] ἥν: possessive pron., see § 24 a.

- διά: by the help of. For the thought, see on 2.832.

- Ἀπόλλων: the sun god, the god of physical and intellectual light, — the prophet of Zeus and the patron of prophecy; cf. “Πολυφείδεα μάντιν Ἀπόλλων ι θῆκε βροτῶν ὄχ̓ ἄριστον ο” 252 f.

- [**73**] 73 = v. 253, “Β 78, 283, Η 326, 367, Ι 95, Ο 285, Σ 253, β 160, 228, η 158, π 399, ω” 53, 453.

- μυθήσασθαι: interpret, as “ὄρνιθας γνῶναι καὶ ἐναίσιμα μυθήσασθαι β” 159.

- [**76**] τοίγαρ ἐγών: always at the beginning of a verse. — “ἐρέω κτλ”.: “Ζ 334, ο 318, π 259, ς 129, ω” 265, I will speak etc., solemn form of introduction; cf. ‘Behold now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth’ Job xxxiii. 2.

- [**77**] ἦ μέν [**“μήν”]: surely and truly, as “Κ 322, Ξ 275, Τ” 109.

- πρόφρων: const. with ἀρήξειν. It is always used predicatively, where the Eng. idiom would prefer an adv.; see § 38 a; “πρόφρονι θυμῷ” and “προφρονέως” are used with the same general force.

- ἔπεσιν καὶ χερσίν: equiv. to the prose “λόγῳ καὶ ἔργῳ” by word and deed; cf. v. 395.

- ἀρήξειν: for the fut. inf. after words of promising or hoping, cf. “μέμασαν … ι τεῖχός τε ῥήξειν καὶ ἐνιπρήσειν πυρὶ νῆας Μ” 197 f., “ἐπῆλθε περησέμεναι μεμαῶσιν Μ” 200.

- [**78**] ἄνδρα: obj. of “χολωσέμεν” shall enrage.

- μέγα: used adv. with “κρατέει”, cf. v. 103, “πολλόν” v. 91, “πολύ” v. 112; it strengthens all three degrees of comparison in Homer, cf. 2.274, 239, 480; see § 38 b.

- [**79**] καί οἱ: for “καὶ ᾧ”. The rel. const. is abandoned as often in later Greek; cf. vs. 3 f., 162, 506; see § 1 d, G. 156, H. 1005. The last half of the verse repeats the same thought in reverse order.

- Ἀχαιοί: used here without distinction of meaning from “Ἀργείων” at the beginning of the verse, see on v. 42; cf. 3.226 f. “Ἀργεῖοι” is never used at the close of a verse, while “Ἀχαιῶν” could not begin the verse.

- [**80**] γάρ: introduces a further explanation of his special need (cf. “πρόφρων” v. 77) of protection.

- ὅτε χώσεται: Att. “ὅταν χώσηται”, whenever his wrath is roused. For the short mode vowel, see § 27 a. For the hypothetical rel. sent. without “ἄν” or “κέ”, cf. vs. 230, 543, 554, Od. 1.352.

- χέρηι: a subject, man of low degree; a positive to the comp. “χερείων” v. 114 (Att. “χείρων”).

- [**81**] “εἴ περ κτλ”.: for even if, with the subjv., as “ἡ δ̓ εἴ πέρ τε τύχῃσι μάλα σχεδόν, οὐ δύναταί σφιν ι χραισμεῖν Λ” 116 f., 22.191 on v. 82.

- χόλον: a burst of anger, while “κότος” is the lasting grudge which plans for revenge, and the “μῆνις” of Achilles led him simply to withdraw from the fight (see on v. 1). “χόλον” is emphasized in contrast with “κότον” by “γέ” and by its chiastic position (§ 2 o).

- καταπέψῃ: digest, suppress; cf. “Ἀχιλεὺς . . . ἐπὶ νηυσὶ χόλον θυμαλγέα πέσσει Δ” 512 f.

- [**82**] ἀλλά: after “εἴπερ”, as Lat. at after si, yet; the apod. is really contrasted with the prot. (§ 3 n). The reciprocal relation of the thoughts is marked by the “τέ . . . τέ” (§ 3 o), cf. v. 218, 3.12, 33 f., “τὸν” (sc. a hound) “δ̓ εἴ πέρ τε λάθῃσι” (sc. a fawn) “καταπτήξας ὑπὸ θάμνῳ”,

- φράσαι: aor. mid. imv., make clear to thyself, consider; “φράζω” in Homer does not mean tell.

- εἰ: whether.

- 84 = “Ι 307, 606, 643, Λ 607, Τ 145, 198, Φ 222, Ψ” 93, cf. v. 215, “Σ 187, Ω” 138. The first hemistich (with “τήν” occasionally for “τόν”) is used in Homer more than 100 times.

- [**85**] θάρσησας: cf. v. 92.

- μάλα: const. with the imv., as v. 173.

- [**86**] οὐ μά: no, in truth; “μά” is a par ticle of swearing with the acc., which prob. depends upon a verb implied. In affirmative asseverations “ϝαὶ μά” is used, as v. 234. The neg. is repeated in v. 88 for greater earnestness, as 23.43 f., Od. 3.27 f.

- διίφιλον: only here as epith. of a divinity.

- ᾧ τε εὐχόμενος: he prayed to Apollo as his patron, the god of prophecy who revealed to him what he declared to the Greeks.

- Κάλχαν: voc. like “Αἶαν Η” 288.

- [**87**] θεοπροπίας: a collateral form to “θεοπρόπιον” v. 85, see § 19.

- ἀναφαίνεις: art wont to reveal, cf. “φαῖνε ἀοιδήν θ” 499.

- [**88**] ἐμεῦ ζῶντος: while I live; in a threatening tone. — “ἐπὶ χθονὶ κτλ”.: a poetic expression for “ζῶντος”, cf. “ὁρᾷ φάος ἠελίοιο Σ 61, ἐπὶ χθονὶ σῖτον ἔδοντες θ” 222, vivus vidensque Terent. Eun. i. “Ι”. 28. For the fulness of expression, see § 1 s; cf. vs. 57, 99, 160, 177, 288 f., 553, “Γ 71, Ξέρξης μὲν αὐτὸς ζὴ τε καὶ βλέπει φάος” Aesch. Pers. 297, ‘as sure as I live and breathe.’

- [**89**] βαρείας: heavy, i.e. violent.

- χεῖρας ἐποίσει: cf. “χεῖρας ἐφείω” v. 567.

- [**90**] οὐδ̓ ἤν: not even if, generally as here after a neg. “This promise will hold even if.”

- Ἀγαμέμνονα: Calchas had indicated him clearly in vs. 78 f.

- [**91**] πολλόν: for its inflection, see § 20 f.; for its adv. use, cf. “μέγα” vs. 78, 103; “πολύ” v. 112.

- ἄριστος: mightiest, as commander-in-chief of the army; cf. 2.82, 580, see on 2.108. — The Homeric heroes were always frank of speech; Achilles calls himself “ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν” vs. 244, 412; Odysseus says that his fame reaches to the heavens, “καί μευ κλέος οὐρανὸν ἵκει ι” 20; Hector challenges the bravest of the Achaeans to fight “Ἕκτ<*> δίῳ Η” 75. cf. sum pius Aeneas fama super aethera notus Verg. Aen. i. 378 f. But the formula “εὔχομαι εἶναι” often contains no idea of boasting, and may mean only claim to be, affirm himself to be.

- [**91]

- [**92**] καὶ τότε δή: and so then (temporal).

- θάρσησε: took courage, inceptive aor.; cf. vs. 331, 349, 517.

- ἀμύμων: refers generally to nobility of birth, or to beauty or strength of person.

- 93 = v. 65, with the change of “οὔτε” for “εἴτε”.

- [**94**] ἕνεκ̓ ἀρητῆρος: const. with “ἐπιμέμφεται”. The prep. is used here, perhaps, because of the remoteness of the noun from the verb, but the poet was free.

- [**95**] “οὐδ̓ ἀπέλυσε κτλ”.: a more definite statement of “ἠτίμησε”, abandoning the rel. const., cf. v. 79. In later Greek, partics. would be expected, instead of the indic.

- καὶ οὐκ: is used, not “οὐδέ”, since the neg. is construed closely with the verb; cf. on v. 28.

- [**96**] τούνεκ̓ ἄρα: on this account then (as I said). This repeats emphatically v. 94, and adds a prediction of the results of the god's anger. — For the crasis, see § 8.

- [**97**] ὅ γε: emphatic repetition of the subj., cf. vs. 65, 496, “πολλὰ δ̓ ὅ γ̓ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα α” 4 which Vergil copied in multum ille et terris iactatus et alto Aen. i. 3. — “Δαϝαοῖσιν κτλ”.: cf. v. 67.

- ἀπὸ δόμεναι: cf. “δόμεναι πάλιν” v. 116. The subj. of the verb is easily supplied from “Δαναοῖσιν”.

- ἑλικώπιδα: quickeyed.

- [**99**] ἀπριάτην ἀνάποινον: for the asyndeton, see §2 l, cf. 2.325.

- ἱερήν: standing epith. of the hecatomb, as vs. 431, 443.

- [**100**] ἱλασσόμενοι: for the manner of propitiation, cf.

- “στρεπτοὶ δέ τε καὶ θεοὶ αὐτοί …

- καὶ μὲν τοὺς θυέεσσι καὶ εὐχωλῇς ἀγανῇσιν

- λοιβῇ τε κνίσῃ τε παρατρωπῶς᾿ ἄνθρωποι

- λισσόμενοι

- ”

- 9.497 ff.

- πεπίθοιμεν: for the reduplication of the 2d aor., see § 25 j.

- [**101**] Vs. 101-187. Quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles.

- εὐρὺ κρείων: standing epith. of the king, as vs. 355, 411, 3.178; see § 4 c; cf. 2.108. For the adv. use of “εὐρύ”, <*> ee on “πολλόν” v. 91.

- [**103**] = Od. 4.661 <*>

- μένεος: with rage, cf. “μένεος δ̓ ἐμ<*> ήσατο” (sc. Achilles) “θυμόν Χ” 312.

- ἀμφιμέλαιναι: darkened on all sides. The mind is dark with passion, which is thought of as a cloud enveloping the φρένες. cf. “Γ 442, θάρσευς πλῆσε φρένας ἀμφιμελαίνας Ρ 573, ἄχος πύκασε φρένας κτλ. Ρ 83, μελαγχίτων φρήν” Aesch. Pers. 117 black-robed heart, of a mind foreboding ill.

- [**104**] οἷ: dat. with the verb, instead of a limiting gen. with “ὄσσε”, see § 3 g.

- λαμπετόωντι: in contrast with “ἀμφιμέλαιναι”. — cf. v. 200.

- [**105**] For the asyndeton, see § 2 l.f.

- πρώτιστα: for the form, see on 2.228.

- κάκ̓ ὀσσόμενος: looking evil, i.e. with look that boded ill; cf. “ὄσσοντο ὄλεθρον β 152, κακὸν ὀσσομένη Ω” 172. For the accent of “κάκ̓” (for “κακά”) see § 10 d.

- [**106**] μάντι κακῶν: ill-boding seer. Some of the ancients thought this referred to the seer's words at Aulis, where he showed that Artemis demanded the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter Iphigenia in return for an insolent word of the king (Soph. El. 566 ff.). — cf. ‘But I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil’ 1 Kings xxii. 8.

- τὸ κρήγυον: equiv. to “ἐσθλόν” v. 108, in contrast with “κακῶν”. For the generic use of the art., cf. “τὰ κακά” v. 107, and see on “τὰ χερείονα” v. 576.

- [**107**] αἰεἰ: he exaggerates in his anger. cf. “σοὶ δ̓ αἰεὶ κραδίη στερεωτέρη ἐστὶ λίθοιο ψ” 103.

- τὰ κακά: subj. of the verb of which “φίλα” is pred.

- μαντεύεσθαι: explanatory inf., cf. “ἔνθα φίλ̓ ὀπταλέα κρέα ἔδμεναι κτλ. Δ” 345. — “Always is it pleasing to thee to prophesy calamity.”

- [**108**] τέλεσσας: brought to pass, cf. “ἅμα μῦθος ἔην τετέλεστο δὲ ἔργον Τ” 242.

- ἑκηβόλος: for the epith. used as a proper name, cf. v. 37.

- τεύχει: see on “ἔθηκεν” v. 2.

- [**111**] ἐγώ: Agamemnon speaks only of the rejection of the ransom, not of the slight offered to the priest; but gives prominence to the odious charge that he, their king, was the cause of the sufferings of the Danaï.

- κούρης Χρυσηίδος: gen. of price, cf. “δῶκ̓ υἷος ποινὴν” (as a price for his son) “Γανυμήδεος Ε 266, λ” 327. For the patronymic, see on v. 13.

- [**112**] ἐπεί: introduces the explanation of “οὐκ ἔθελον” was not inclined; cf. v. 156.

- βούλομαι: contains the idea of choice, preference (sc. “ἢ ἄποινα δέχεσθαι”), which is here strengthened by the adv. “πολύ” (acc. of extent). cf. v. 117.

- αὐτήν: the maiden herself, contrasted with the ransom. — To his accusation against Calchas, the king adds at once his own defence.

- [**113**] οἴκοι ἔχειν: i.e. to retain in my possession, cf. “οἴκοθεν Η” 364 from his own possessions, Od. 17.455.

- καί: even, constr. with “Κλυταιμνήστρης”.

- γάρ ῥα: for, you see.

- Κλυταιμνήστρης: acc. to the later story, daughter of Tyndareüs and Leda, and thus half-sister of Helen. The ancient Greek on hearing these lines remembered well that Clytaemnestra proved unfaithful to Agamemnon, and slew him on his return to his home (Od. 11.411 ff.). She was herself slain by her son Orestes (Od. 3.306 ff.). The deaths of Agamemnon and Clytaemnestra formed the theme of famous tragedies by the three greatest tragic poets of Greece, — the Agamemnon and Choëphoroe of Aeschylus, the Electra of Sophocles, and the Electra of Euripides.

- προβέβουλα: with pres. signification, cf. “δείδια” fear “δ 820, ἔολπα” hope Od. 2.275.

- [**114**] οἴ ἑθεν: for the hiatus, see §§ 9 f., 14. The neg. receives emphasis from its position.

- [**115**] οὐ δέμας: not in build, prob. refers to her stature, as the Greeks always associated height and beauty, cf. “Γ 167, καλός τε μέγας τε Φ 108, καλῇ τε μεγάλῃ τε καὶ ἀγλαὰ ἔργα ἰδυίῃ ν 289, Τυδεὺς μικρὸς μὲν ἔην δέμας Ε” 801.

- οὐδὲ φυήν: has reference to her fair proportions. — With these two qualities of her person are contrasted by asyndeton two mental characteristics, neither in mind nor in accomplishments.

- [**116**] καὶ ὥς: even thus, “altho' Chryseis is so beautiful and accomplished,” cf. 3.159.

- δόμεναι πάλιν: restore, cf. “ἀποδοῦναι” vs. 98, 134.

- [**118**] αὐτίχ̓ ἑτοιμάσατε: the unreasonableness of the demand provokes the quarrel with Achilles and elicits the epith. “φιλοκτεανώτατε” v. 122. — “γέρας κτλ”.: made more definite later, cf. vs. 138, 182 ff.

- [**119**] ἔω: for the form, see § 34 g.

- οὐδὲ ἔοικεν: it is not even seemly, to say nothing of its unfairness.

- [**120**] ὅ: like quod equiv. to “ὅτι” that; cf. “γιγνώσκων ὅ ο<*>αὐτὸς ὑπείρεχε χεῖρας Ἀπόλλων Ε 43<*> Θ” 32, 140.

- ἔρχεται ἄλλῃ: i.e. lea<*>s me. “ἔρχεται” is used of the imm<*>iate future, as “Λ 839, Ξ” 301.

- [**122**] κίδιστε: a<*>nding epith. of Agamemnon, cf. “Β 434, Ι” 96, 163, 677, 697. The following epith. is contrasted bitterly with this.

- [**123**] “πῶς κτλ”.: the question implies the absurdity of the proposition, cf. 4.26 where Hera asks Zeus “πῶς ἐθέλεις ἅλιον” (fruitless) “θεῖναι πόνον ἠδ̓ ἀτέλεστον”;

- γάρ: introduces the explanation of some gesture of surprise or vexation; its force may often be given by the excl. ‘what.’

- [**124**] “ξυνήια κτλ”.: undisturbed treasures lying in abundance, from which the king could be recompensed easily for the loss of his prize. This again refers to Agamemnon's “αὐτίκα” v. 118. — Booty taken on their marauding expeditions was the common property of the army after the several prizes of honor (“γέρα”, v. 185) had been selected for the chiefs, cf. vs. 368 f., “ἐκ πόλιος δ̓ ἀλόχους καὶ κτήματα πολλὰ λαβόντες ι δασσάμεθ̓ ὡς μή τίς μοι ἀτεμβόμενος κίοι ἴσης ι” 41 f.; “μοῖραν καὶ γέρας ἐσθλὸν ἔχων λ” 534 of Achilles's son returning from Troy, “τῶν ἐξαιρεύμην μενοεικέα” (satisfying my heart), “πολλὰ δ̓ ὀπίσσω ι λάγχανον ξ” 232. These prizes were sometimes selected by the leaders themselves, as 9.129 f., 11.696 f., 704; but are often spoken of as the gift of the people, vs. 276, 369, 392, “Λ 627, Π 56, Σ 444, η 10, ι” 160, 550 f. Doubtless they were distributed by the general, with the approval of the army. Thus, 9.367, Agamemnon is said by Achilles to have given Briseis to him.

- [**125**] τά, τά: strictly both are dems. (§§ 3 n f., 24 l), the second repeating the first, although the first may be translated as a rel.

- τὰ μέν: the thought contrasted with this, is implied in vs. 127 ff.

- πολίων: cities near Troy, of which Achilles had sacked 12 with his fleet and 11 with a land force, 9.328 f. Homer mentions the sack of Lesbos 9.129, of Lyrnessus 2.690, of Pedasus Od. 3.92, of Scyrus 9.668, of Tenedos 11.625, of Thebe “Ζ 415, Ι” 188. cf. Nestor's words, “ξὺν νηυσὶν ἐπ̓ ἠεροειδέα πόντον”

- “πλαζόμενοι κατὰ ληίδ̓, ὅπῃ ἄρξειεν Ἀχιλλεύς γ” 105 f. . . . wandering for booty wherever Achilles led. The gen. depends upon the following prep. in composition.

- ἐξεπράθομεν: equiv. to “ἐξείλομεν πέρσαντες”.

- δέδασται: the tense marks that the matter has been settled and is not to be reconsidered.

- παλίλλογα: proleptic, “so as to be together.”

- [**127**] θεῷ: in honor of the god, for the god's sake, dat. of interest; cf. “Μενέλαος ᾧ δὴ τόνδε πλοῦν ἐστείλαμεν” Soph. Aj. 1045 Menelaus, for whose sake we undertook this voyage.

- ἐυτείχεον: Poseidon built the walls (21.446).

- 131 = 19.155.

- μὴ δή: with imv. as 5.218; with inf. used as imv., as 17.501; with subjv. used as imv., “Ε 684, Ψ” 7.

- δὴ οὕτως: for the synizesis, cf. vs. 340, 540; see § 7 a.

- [**129]

- [**132**] κλέπτε νόῳ: have secret thoughts in mind, be deceitful, — an accusation most hateful to the outspoken Achilles (see 9.312 f.); cf. “εἰ μὴ τῷ χρόνῳ κεκλέμμεθα” Soph. Ant. 681 if we have not been deceived etc., “ὣς οὐκ ἔστι Διὸς κλέψαι νόον οὔτε παρελθεῖν” Hes. Theog. 613. cf. Eng. steal and stealth.

- μέ: const. with both verbs.

- [**133**] “ἦ ἐθέλεις κτλ”.: dost thou wish indeed that thou thyself shouldst have a prize of honor (referring to v. 126) while (lit. but) I etc. He replies to the charge of covetousness (v. 122) by the assertion that Achilles has a selfish end in view in urging him to give up Chryseis.

- αὔτως: explained by “δευόμενον”, see § 24 h.

- [**136**] “ἄρσαντες κτλ”.: suiting it to my mind, i.e. choosing one which will be satisfactory.

- ἀντάξιον: sc. “Χρυσηίδος”. — The conclusion of the sent. is omitted (aposiopesis); it would be perhaps “εὖ ἔχει, καλῶς ἂν ἔχοι”. When two mutually exclusive cond. sents. stand side by side, the conclusion of the first may be omitted. 7.904 a.

- 137 = 324.

- ἐγὼ δέ: for “δέ” in apod., see on v. 58.

- [**138**] τεόν: sc. “γέρας”.

- Αἴαντος: son of Telamon, from Salamis (2.557), the mightiest of all the Greeks except Achilles (2.768, and note). He is not to be confounded with the swiftfooted leader of the Locrians, Ajax son of Oïleus (2.527). Telamonian Ajax is always meant when no distinguishing epith. is used. F<*> committed suicide because the <*>ms of Achilles, after that hero's de<*>h, were given to Odysseus rather th<*> to him (Od. 11.543 ff.).

- ἰών: cf. “ἰὼν κλ<*>ίηνδε” v. 185. Homer is fond of <*> partic. which completes the pict<*> but is not strictly necessary to the sense, as “ἄγων” v. 311, “ἐλθών” v. 401, “ἑλών” v. 139, “ἰδών” v. 537, “ἰών, λαβών Β 261, παραστάς Β 189, φέρουσα Γ 425, ἀμφιέποντες Β 525, εὐχόμενος Β” 597. These partics. are commonly intr. in this use.

- Ὀδυσῆος: the hero of the Odyssey, the wise Ithacan prince (2.636) by whose device of the wooden horse Ilios was captured (Od. 22.230).

He restrains the Achaeans from following a mad impulse to set out for home, 2.169 ff.; he chastises Thersites, 2.244 ff. His personal appearance as an orator is described, 3.191 ff. He is sent as an envoy to Achilles in the Ninth Book. He enters the Trojan camp as a spy, with Diomed, in the Tenth Book. He is the special favorite of Athene, see on 2.169. — Agamemnon expresses his sovereignty in an arbitrary way, declaring his absolute authority over the three mightiest princes of the army.

He was one of the older leaders, cf. “μεσαιπόλιος Ν” 361 grizzled. He reached home in safety, after the war (Od. 3.191).

- [**155**] Φθίῃ: the later Phthiotis (2.683), not the city, as is shown by the epith. “ἐριβώλακι. — βωτιανείρῃ”: cf. “κουροτρόφος” as epith. of Ithaca, Od. 9.27.

The highest impudence was indicated by “κυνάμυια Φ” 394 dog-fly. In the Odyssey, however, the dog seems to be in better favor.

- σοί: i.e. like to thine, for “τῷ σῷ γέραϊ”, the person instead of the attribute being compared; cf. “κόμαι” (hair) “χαρίτεσσιν ὁμοῖαι Ρ 51, ὁμοῖα νοήματα Πηνελοπείῃ β” 121 thoughts like to Penelope. G. 186, N. 2; H. 773 b.

Theog. 96. Kings are called “θεράποντες Διός” (Od. 11.255) as warriors are “θεράποντες Ἄρηος” (2.110). Reverence for royal blood is expressed in “δεινὸν” (a dreadful thing) “δὲ γένος βασιλήιόν ἐστιν ι κτείνειν π” 401.

- [**180**] Μυρμιδόνεσσιν: cf. 2.684; dat. of advantage, see § 3 g. This word is made prominent since the thought is before the speaker's mind that Achilles, in the consciousness of his strength, desires to rule all the Achaeans, cf. vs. 287 ff.

- σέθεν κοτέοντος: “thy anger,” cf. v. 160.

- σέθεν: for this form of the gen., see § 15 e.

- [**182**] ὡς: just as; the corresponding thought of the apod. is found in “ἐγὼ κτλ”. v. 184. The interposed clause, “τὴν μὲν κτλ”., has properly only the value of a subord. clause, though with the form of a principal sent., see § 3 q; cf. 8.269.

- [**268**] φηρσίν: cf. “φῆρας Β 743. φήρ” is the Thessalian form of “θήρ” (cf. fera); it is used by Homer only of the centaurs, whose homes were in Thessaly. The centaurs are not described by Homer, but their dual nature (half man, half horse) seems to have been not yet developed in the story.

- ἀπόλεσσαν: “ἀπώλεσαν”.

- [**269**] καί: even; const. with “τοῖσιν”. The new thought is introduced by “καί” also vs. 271, 273, with increasing emphasis. — The thought returns to v. 261.

- τοῖσιν: the Lapithae. The dat. is governed by “μετά” in composition; see on “πολίων” v. 125.

- [**270**] ἐξ ἀπίης γαίης: from a distant land, explaining “τηλόθεν”.

- ἀπίης: cf. 3.49.

- καλέσαντο: called to their aid, cf. “αὐτοὶ γάρ σφεας” (Locrians and Phocians) “οἱ Ἕλληνες” (at Thermopylae) “ἐπεκαλέσαντο” Hdt. vii. 203. — Nestor relates other achievements of his youth and strength, 4.318 f., 7.133 ff., 11.670 ff., 23.629 ff.

- [**271**] κατ̓ ἔμ̓ αὐτόν: by myself alone, i.e. as a single champion; cf. “κατὰ σφέας Β 366. ἐμαυτόν” is not found in Homer as a single word (§ 24 c).

- κείνοισιν: the centaurs.

- [**272**] “οἳ νῦν κτλ”.: who now live as mortals upon the earth.

- ἐπιχθόνιοι: equiv. to “ἐπὶ χθονὶ ὄντες”. H. 588. cf. “ἀνέρες . . . ἐπὶ χθονὶ σῖτον ἔδοντες ι” 89.

- μαχέοιτο: pres. opt. from “μαχέομαι”, a collateral form of “μάχομαι”, cf. “αἰδεῖσθαι” v. 23 with “αἰδομένω” v. 331.

- [**273**] ξύνιεν: “ξυνίεσαν”, cf. “τράφεν” v. 251 for “ἐτράφησαν”, §§ 26 w, 34 e. — Note the parallelism of the two halves of the verse, cf. v. 79.

- [**275**] ἀγαθός περ ἐών: as v. 131.

- ἀποαίρεο [**“ἀφαιροῦ”]: syncopated from “ἀποαιρέεο”, § 29 h. It is followed by two accs., as v. 182.

- [**276**] ἔα: sc. “κούρην”.

- ὡς πρῶτα: as once, cf. v. 6.

- δόσαν: Att. “ἔδωκαν”. See on v. 124.

- [**277**] μήτε θέλε: noli, cf. “Β 247, μηδὲ θεοῖσιν ι ἶς᾿ ἔθελε φρονέειν Ε” 440 f., 7.111.

- βασιλῆι: used esp. of Agamemnon, as v. 9.

- [**278**] ἀντιβίην: originally cognate acc., sc. “ἔριδα”, cf. 3.435; the adv. receives emphasis from its position.

- οὔ ποθ̓ ὁμοίης: i.e. a greater. The Greek idiom leaves to the connection the determination of the exact meaning. cf. post mihi non simili poena commissa luetis Verg. Aen. i. 136.

- ἔμμορε: has share of, has received.

- [**279**] “ᾧ τε Ζεὺς κτλ”.: see on v. 176.

- [**280**] εἰ: not cond. in thought here, cf. “εἰ τότε κοῦρος ἔα, νῦν αὖτέ με γῆρας ὀπάξει Δ 321. — καρτερός”: as v. 178. — “θεὰ δὲ κτλ”.: second clause of the protasis, explaining the first “being son of a goddess.”

- θεά: Thetis, cf. vs. 351 ff.

- [**281**] ἀλλά: for its use in the apod., see on v. 82.

- φέρτερος: more powerful.

- πλεόνεσσιν: see 2.108, 576 ff.

- [**282**] Ἀτρεΐδη, σὺ δέ: the voc. often precedes the pron.; it has no const. in the sent. and thus cannot be followed immediately by “δέ”. cf. “Β 344, Ἕκτορ, ἀτὰρ σύ μοί ἐσσι πατὴρ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ Ζ 429, ἄττα, σὺ δ̓ ἔρχεο θᾶσσον π” 130.

- παῦε: cf. vs. 192, 207.

- αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε: “And I also on my part beg thee.”

- [**283**] λίσσομαι: sc. “δέ. — Ἀχιλλῆι”: for the dat. of opposition, cf. “Θ 449, Ν 517, Ξ” 50. For the long “ι” of the dat. sing., see § 18 a. This may be explained also as before the caesural pause (§ 41 p). The name is used with special emphasis, cf. v. 240, instead of the pron. (vs. 275, 281).

- μεθέμεν: “μεθεῖναι”, § 34 e; cf. “μεθήμων Β” 241. — “ὃς μέγα κτλ”.: gives the motive for the request.

- [**284**] ἕρκος πολέμοιο: as 4.299, cf. “ἕρκος ἀκόντων Δ 137, ἕρκος βελέων Ε” 316; for the ablatival gen., see § 3 d. With another use of the gen., Ajax is called “ἕρκος Ἀχαιῶν Γ” 229.

- 286 = “Θ 146, Ω” 379; cf. “Κ 169, Ψ 626, δ 266, ς 170, υ” 37.

- πάντα: is not to be urged in meaning; it refers esp. to v. 284. Agamemnon admits no fault on his part but throws all the blame on Achilles, cf. “ἀλλά” below.

- [**284]

- [**287**] περὶ πάντων: see on v. 258.

- [**288**] For the asyndeton, see § 2 m; this verse repeats the thought of the foregoing, in a different form. The speaker's passion is shown by the accumulation of synonymous expressions, § 1 s.

- [**289**] ἅ: in which, acc. of specification.

- τινά: some one, esp. Agamemnon himself.

- πείσεσθαι: from “πείθω”.

- [**290**] αἰχμητήν: pregnant, for “κρατερὸς αἰχμητής Γ” 179.

- ἔθεσαν: equiv. to Att. “ἐποίησαν”, see on “ἔθηκεν” v. 2.

- αἰὲν ἐόντες: cf. “θεῶν αἰειγενετάων Β” 400.

- [**291**] προθέουσιν: a form not found elsewhere from the stem “θε”-, for “προτιθέασιν”, i.e. commission him, allow him. The word seems chosen here with reference to “ἔθεσαν”.

- [**292**] ὑποβλήδην: interrupting, cf. “ὑββάλλειν Τ” 80.

- [**293**] ἦ γάρ: he gives at once the reason for his course.

- καλεοίμην: should be called, i.e. should be; cf. “Β 260, Γ 138, αἲ γὰρ ἐμοὶ τοιόσδε πόσις κεκλημένος εἴη ζ” 244 would that such a man might be (called) my husband, “ἐμὴ γυνὴ μόνη κεκλήσει” Eur. Alc. 329 f. thou alone shalt be (called) my wife.

- [**294**] From Agamemnon's complaint, vs. 287 ff., Achilles infers that he is expected to obey in everything (“πᾶν ἔργον”).

- εἰ δή: “in case that I actually.”

- πᾶν ἔργον: only here before the formula “ὅττι κεν εἴπῃς” (cf. “Β 361, Ε 421, α 158, 389, β” 25, 161, 229).

- ὑπείξομαι: the form of the cond. is changed, and the fut. ind. is used in the protasis instead of the opt. with “ἄν”.

- [**295**] δή: const. with the imv., as v. 131.

- ταῦτα: “πᾶν ἔργον ὑπείκεσθαι”.

- μὴ γὰρ ἐμοί: in contrast with “ἄλλοισιν”.

- [**296**] οὐ: const with “ἔτι”, as in prose they are united, “οὐκέτι”, § 37 b “γ”.

- ὀίω: with the fut. inf., as v. 170. — This verse is parallel with v. 289.

- 297 = “Δ 39, Ε 259, Ι 611, Π” 444, 851, “Φ 94, λ 454, π 281, 299, ρ 548, τ” 236, 495, 570. — Used when the speaker changes the subject in the middle of his speech; it is followed by the new thought without a conj. — cf. accipite ergo animis atque haec mea figite dicta Verg. Aen. iii. 250.

- [**298**] μέν: correl. with “δέ” v. 300; the contrast is changed from that between action and heart, to one between “κούρης” and “τῶν ἄλλων”.

- κούρης: would have the art. in prose.

- [**299**] ἀφέλεσθε: the aor. assumes that Agamemnon's threat has been executed, and the 2d pers. holds the Achaeans responsible because of their acquiescence (cf. v. 231).

- δόντες: ye who gave; cf. Achilles's words, “γέρας δέ μοι ὅς περ ἔδωκεν ι αὐτὸς ἐφυβρίζων ἑλετο κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων Ι” 367 f.

- [**300**] θοῇ: for such standing epiths., see § 1 p.

- παρὰ νηί: i.e. in my tent, cf. v. 329. — For the position of the adjs., see § 1 m.

- [**301**] τῶν: anaphoric, repeating “τῶν ἄλλων”.

- οὐκ ἄν τι φέροις: the opt. with “ἄν” and a neg. often expresses a confident expectation, and sometimes approaches a threat, as here, 9.375 f., Od. 22.325.

- φέροις ἀνελών: cf. “ἄξω ἑλών” v. 139.

- [**302**] εἰ: retains its original force as an interjection; “up then, come.”

- ἄγε: see on v. 62.

- γνώωσι: shall recognize it, perceive it, referring to the following verse; cf. vs. 185, 333. For the form, see § 34 d.

- [**304**] μαχησαμένω: cf. “μάχεσθαι” v. 8.

- [**305**] ἀνστήτην: stood up, rose from their seats. The speeches of vs. 285303 were uttered informally, while sitting, cf. v. 246.

- [**306**] Vs. 306-347. Purification of the camp. Chryseis is returned to her father. Briseis is led from the tent of Achilles.

- [**307**] ἤιε: from “εἶμι”, see § 34 f.

- Μενοιτιάδῃ: Patroclus was so well known to the hearers of Homer, from old stories and songs, that he needed no more exact designation here; cf. the use of “Ἀτρεΐδης” v. 7. See § 21 b. When a boy in Opus he killed a comrade in a fit of anger and was taken by his father to Phthia where Peleus received him kindly (23.84 ff.), and brought him up with Achilles. He attended Achilles on this Trojan ex pedition as his warmest and most faithful friend and squire (“θεράπων, Σ” 80 ff., 24.4 ff.). The narrative of his exploits fills a large part of the Sixteenth Book of the Iliad. He was slain by Hector (16.818 ff.). To avenge his death, Achilles ends his quarrel with Agamemnon. Most of the Twenty-third Book is occupied with an account of the funeral games in his honor.

- [**308**] “Ἀτρεΐδης κτλ”.: as he had planned (“ἄρα”), vs. 141 ff.

- προέ ρυσσεν: caused to be drawn down from its position on shore, cf. v. 486, 2.152 f.

- [**309**] ἐς δέ: as v. 142. All four advs. (“ἐς, ἐς, ἀνά, ἐν”) refer to “νῆα”, supplied from v. 308.

- ἐς δέ: into it, adv. with “βῆσε”.

- ἐείκοσιν: ships for other purposes than war generally have twenty oarsmen in Homer. cf. “νἦ ἄρσας ἐρέτῃσιν ἐείκοσιν . . . ἔρχεο πευσόμενος πατρός α” 280 f., “δ 669, ἱστὸν νηὸς ἐεικοσόροιο ι” 322.

- [**310**] βῆσε: for the causative use of this tense of “βαίνω”, cf. “βήσομεν” v. 144.

- ἀνά: adv. with “εἷσεν” (aor. from “ἵζω”).

- [**311**] ἄγων: see on v. 138.

- ἀρχός: cf. v. 144.

- Ὀδυσσεύς: as “πολύμητις, πολυμήχανος”, he was often sent on embassies, cf. “Γ 205, Ι 169, Λ” 767.

- [**311]

- [**312**] The story which is here broken off, of the voyage to Chrysa, is resumed v. 430.

- [**313**] ἀπολυμαίνεσθαι: they were to purify themselves symbolically from the sin of Agamemnon which had brought upon them the pestilence. cf. the action of the children of Israel, after their idolatry: ‘And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the Lord, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the Lord,’ 1 Sam. vii. 6. They trusted that the pollution would depart from them into the sea, where they washed themselves.

- [**315**] τεληέσσας: cf. on v. 66.

- [**316**] παρὰ θῖνα: as v. 34. The line of people was stretched out along the strand.

- [**317**] περὶ καπνῷ: around, in the smoke; for the adv. use of “περί”, cf. “Χ 95, θ” 426; see § 37 a. Cf. “κνίσην δ̓ ἐκ πεδίου ἄνευοι φέρον οὐρανὸν εἴσω Θ” 549.

- [**318**] Transition to another scene, which fills the blank during the jour ney of the embassy to Chrysa.

- κατὰ στρατόν: (down) through the camp, cf. “ἀνὰ στρατόν” vs. 10, 53, “κατὰ νῆας Β 47, κατὰ βωμούς Β” 305.

- [**319**] ἔριδος: as v. 210.

- πρῶτον: once, see on v. 6.

- ἐπηπείλησε: vs. 181 ff.

- [**320**] Ταλθύβιον: the principal herald of Agamemnon, cf. “Γ 118, Δ 192, Η 276, Τ 196, 250, 267, Ψ” 897. According to Herodotus (vii. 134), he had a sanctuary at Sparta, and his family lived there long as heralds.

- Εὐρυβάτην: only here as herald of Agamemnon; to be distinguished from Odysseus's herald of the same name, see on 2.184.

- προσέειπεν: is regularly followed by the direct address in the next verse, but occasionally some incidental remark intervenes by way of parenthesis, as here and Od. 17.342 ff.

- [**321**] θεράποντε: companions, squires. Patroclus is “θεράπων” of Achilles (18.152), brave warriors are called “θεράποντες Ἄρηος” (2.110), and kings “θεράποντες Διός” (Od. 11.255, see on v. 176).

- [**322**] ἔρχεσθον: here followed by the acc. of limit of motion, without a prep.; see § 3 i. This const. is freq. with “ἵκω, ἱκάνω, ἱκνέομαι”, but rare with “βαίνω, εἶμι, ἔρχομαι”. — Agamemnon does not go in person (“αὺτός” v. 185) since Achilles had declared (v. 298) that he would make no resistance.

- [**323**] χειρός: gen. of the part touched, with “ἑλόντε”, cf. “κόμης” v. 197, “ποδός” v. 591.

- ἀγέμεν: inf. for the imv., parallel with “ἔρχεσθον”, see on “δέχεσθαι” v. 20. — This contains an explanation of the preceding imv. and hence is not connected with it by a conj. (§ 2 m), cf. v. 363.

- 324 = v. 137, with “δώῃσιν” for “δώωσιν”.

- [**325**] καί: strengthens “ῥίγιον”.

- ῥίγιον: for its formation, see § 22 b.

- [**326**] ἵει . . . ἔτελλεν: as v. 25.

- μῦθον: the preceding command.

- [**327**] ἀέκοντε: because of their dread and reverence for Achilles, cf. v. 331. For the form, see § 6 a.

- βάτην [**“ἐβήτην”]: dual forms generally have no aug. in Homer.

- παρὰ θῖνα: cf. v. 347. The quarters of Achilles were at the extreme right of the camp, cf. “ἐπ᾽ Αἴαντος κλισίας … ἠδ᾽ ἐπ᾽ Ἀχιλλῆος, τοί ῤ̔ ἔσχατα νῆας ἐίσας

- εἴρυσαν, ἠνορέῃ πίσυνοι καὶ κάρτεϊ χειρῶν

- ” 11.7 ff.

- 328 = 9.185, cf. 652.

- [**329**] cf. “Κ 74, Ν 267. — τόν”: refers back to v. 322.

- [**330**] οὐδ̓ ἄρα: but naturally not.

- γήθησεν: inceptive aor., cf. vs. 92, 255; “did joy enter his heart.”

- [**331**] ταρβήσαντε: seized by fear (the opposite of “θαρσήσας” v. 85), while the present “αἰδομένω” expresses the continued attitude of their minds, cf. 2.374.

- [**333**] 333 = 8.446.

- ὁ ἔγνω: for the hiatus, cf. v. 532, “Β 105, ἄστυδε ἔλθωμεν ζ” 296; see § 9 b.

- ἔγνω: sc. their errand; cf. v. 302.

- [**334**] χαίρετε: the customary greeting. — “Διὸς ἄγγελοι κτλ”.: as 7.274; inviolable servants of “διοτρεφέων βασιλήων” (on v. 176); hence they are “διίφιλοι Θ” 517. Hermes is not the patron god of heralds in Homer.

- [**335**] ἐπαίτιοι: sc. “ἐστέ”, to blame, cf. v. 153.

- [**336**] ὅ: “ὅς”, § 24 o.

- κούρης: “κοῦρος” and “κούρη” are used esp. of young men and women of noble families; but “κοῦροι Ἀχαιῶν” (v. 473) does not differ materially except in metrical form from “υἷες Ἀχαιῶν” (v. 162).

- [**338**] ἄγειν: final inf., cf. “μάχεσθαι” v. 8, “ἀγέμεν” v. 443, “Β 477, Γ 117. — τὼ δ̓ αὐτώ”: these two themselves. The very men who executed the unjust order are to be witnesses of its injustice and of Achilles's justification in withdrawing from active service.

- [**339**] πρός: in the sight of, before. For the anaphora of the prep., cf. that of “ἐκ” vs. 436 ff.

- θεῶν, ἀνθρώπων: for a strong “all persons”; cf. the words of Zeus, “τόσσον ἐγὼ περί τ̓ εἰμὶ θεῶν περί τ̓ εἴμ̓ ἀνθρώπων Θ” 27.

- [**340**] καί: after “τέ . . . τέ”, gives special prominence to this clause.

- πρὸς τοῦ βασιλῆος ἀπηνέος: before that king, the cruel king, equiv. to “πρὸς τούτου τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ ἀπηνοῦς”. For the order of words, cf. v. 11, “τὸν λωβητῆρα ἐπεσβόλον Β 275, τὰ τεύχεα καλά Φ 317, τοῦ παιδὸς ἀγαυοῦ λ 492, τὸν ξεῖνον δύστηνον ρ” 10. Since the art. is still a dem. in Homer, the foregoing are merely apparent exceptions to the rule that the attributive adj. stands between the article and its noun.

- δὴ αὖτε: for the synizesis, cf. v. 131.

- αὖτε: not again, marking a repetition; but indicating a situation opposed to the present, cf. v. 237.

- [**341**] χρειὼ γένηται: this happens in the Ninth Book, cf. 9.230 ff. — The object before the speaker's mind is Agamemnon; hence at the close of the sent., “τοῖς ἄλλοις” is used instead of the general word “Ἀχαιοῖς”.

- [**342**] τοῖς ἄλλοις: dat. of interest with “ἀμῦναι”, cf. v. 67.

- γα?ρ: lengthened, as 2.39, for an unknown reason.

- [**343**] οὐδέ τι: and not at all. — “νοῆσαι κτλ”.: proverbial expression for prudence, cf. “Γ 109, Σ 250, ω” 452. For the inf. with “οἶδε” knows how, cf. 7.238, 240.

- [**344**] ὅππως: for the doubled “π”, see § 12 a.

- οἷ: ethical dat. with “σόοι μαχεοίατο”.

- μαχεοίατο: that they should fight; the pres. of the principal sent. is followed by the opt., since the purpose is presented as a mere conception of the speaker's mind.

- 345 = “Ι 205, Λ” 616.

- [**344]

- [**347**] ἄγειν: as v. 338.

- [**348**] Vs. 348-430. Achilles tells his grief to his mother. She promises to secure satisfaction for him from Zeus.

- ἀέκουσα: this indicates that she was more than a mere “γέρας” to Achilles, and that his anger arose not simply from the insult offered to his dignity but also from wounded love; cf. 9.343 f. In 19.287 ff., she mourns bitterly for the dead Patroclus on her return to the tent of Achilles.

- γυνή: explanatory appos. with “ἡ”. — The scene ends at the bucolic diaeresis (§ 40 h), cf. vs. 318, 430. “αὐτὰρ Ἀχιλλεύς” is thus used 17 times in the Iliad in the last two feet of the verse, to mark a transition, while “αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεύς” is thus used 27 times in the Odyssey. — “αὐτὰρ Ἀχιλλεὺς κτλ”.: simple description of the effect which the loss of Briseis had upon the hero, without depicting his feelings in modern fashion.

- [**349**] δακρύσας: fell to weeping. Burst into tears is perhaps too strong a translation.

- ἑτάρων: const. with “νόσφι λιασθείς”.

- ἄφαρ: const. with “λιασθείς”, cf. v. 594.

- [**350**] θῖν̓ ἔφ̓ ἁλός: i.e. “ἐπὶ θῖνα κτλ”., with “ἕζετο”.

- ἔφ̓ is accented, in spite of the elision, in order to prevent ambiguity (§ 37 c “β”).

- ἁλός: “ἅλς” and “θάλασσα” are the general words for sea; “πόντος”, the high, deep sea (often with reference to a particular tract, cf. 2.145); “πέλαγος”, the open sea.

- [**351**] πολλά: as v. 35.

- ὀρεγνύς: not “ἀνασχών” (“χεῖρας ἀνασχών” v. 450), since while invoking the sea divinity he stretched out his hands toward the deep; cf. 9.568, where Althaea beats upon the ground as she calls upon the nether gods; palmas ponto tendens utrasque . . . Di, quibus imperium est pelagi Verg. Aen. v. 233 ff.

- [**352**] ἔτεκές γε: the prominence given by “γέ” emphasizes the fact as responsible for the inference which is drawn from it.

- μινυνθάδιον: equiv. to “ὠκύμορος” v. 417.

- πέρ: in its original use, very.

- [**353**] τιμήν περ: honor at least, placed first with emphasis; chiastic with “μινυνθάδιον” (§ 2 o).

- ὄφελλεν: the past tense of verbs of obligation is used to imply that the obligation was not complied with.

- Ὀλύμπιος: is used in the sing. only of Zeus, as v. 589, 2.309; in the pl. of all the gods, as v. 399.

- [**354**] ὑψιβρεμέτης: cf. “δεινὸν δὲ βρόντησε πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε ι ὕψοθεν γ” 56.

- νῦν δέ: but as it is, marking a return to the reality from a merely hypothetical case, cf. v. 417, “Β 82, α” 166, 219, 241.

- οὐδὲ τυτθόν: not even a little.

- 356 = 507, 2.240; cf. 9.111.

- ἑλὼν ἔχει: differs from “εἷλε” chiefly in giving prominence to the possession as still continued; cf. (of the same act) “εἵλετ̓ ἔχει δ̓ ἄλοχον Ι” 336. This approaches a periphrasis common in tragedy, even where the partic. is intrans., and often differing little from the aor. ind. “ἠτίμησε”, etc.; cf. Soph. O. T. 731, Ant. “ἀτιμάσας ἔχει 22, 32, 77, ἐγκλῄσας ἔχει 180, κηρύξας ἔχω 192, ἔχεις ταράξας” 794, 1058, 1272.

- ἀπούρας: partic. of “ἀπηύρων” v. 430; epexegetical of “ἑλών”. For the strengthening by “αὐτός”, cf. vs. 137, 161, 185, 324, 19.89.

- [**357**] “ὣς φάτο κτλ”.: cf. sic fatur lacrimans Verg. Aen. vi. 1.

- 358 = 18.36.

- πατρὶ γέροντι: Nereus, who is not named by Homer but only designated as “ἅλιος γέρων” (v. 538). His home is in the Aegean sea, cf. 24.78. With him is Thetis, who has deserted her aged husband Peleus. The daughters of Nereus are enumerated 18.38 ff.

- [**359**] ἁλός: ablatival gen., from the sea, as “ἀνεδύσετο λίμνης ε” 337; see § 3 d.

- ἠύτ̓ ὀμίχλη: the comparison is esp. fitting for a sea-goddess; like a mist, which rises easily and quietly from the water. For the Homeric comparison, cf. v. 47; see § 2 e ff.

- [**360**] πάροιθ̓ αὐτοῖο: before him (self); the intensive pron. contrasts Achilles himself with his voice which his mother had just heard, cf. v. 47. See § 24 g.

- δάκρυ χέοντος: the repetition of these words from v. 357 is characteristic of the fulness of Epic style.

- 361 = “Ε 372, Ζ 485, Ω 127, δ 610, ε” 181. — For the Epic fulness, cf. vs. 57, 88; see § 1 s.

- εἴδομεν: from “οἶδα”, subjv. with short mode-vowel, cf. vs. 141 ff.; see § 27 a.

- βαρύ: cf. “εὐρύ” v. 355, and see on v. 78.

- [**365**] οἶσθα: cf. vs. 355 f.

- ἦ: is not a simple sign of a question in Homer, and hence can be joined with “τί”, see § 3 m.

- ἰδυίῃ: i.e. “εἰδυίῃ” (with the short form of the stem, § 31 g); intrans., as “Κ 250, Ψ” 787. Though his mother knows all, Achilles tells the story. A man in suffering finds relief in rehearsing his ills, and this recital was followed by the sympathy of the poet's hearers. The repetition is more natural because the consequences of these events continue through the whole poem.

- ἀγορεύω: subjv. of deliberation.—For the verbal repetition, cf. 2.10-15, 23-34, 60-70.

- [**366**] ᾠχόμεθα: on his marauding expeditions in the neighborhood of Troy; see on v. 125.

- [**381**] φίλος ἦεν: sc. “ὁ γέρων”. This was shown by the event.

- [**382**] ἐπ̓ Ἀργείοισι: “ἐπί” with dat. of the person, in Homer often implies hostility, cf. v. 51; see § 3 h “β”.

- [**385]

- [**386**] κελόμην: cf. v. 62 ff. and on v. 74.

- [**388**] ἠπείλησεν μῦθον: the Eng. idiom reverses the const., he uttered the threat.

- ὅ: “ὅς”, as v. 336.

- [**389**] τὴν μέν: contrasted with “τὴν δέ” v. 391.

- σὺν νηί: with a ship, almost equiv. to by ship. This expression seems more instrumental than where the comrades also are mentioned, cf. vs. 179, 183.

- [**390**] πέμπουσιν: escort (§ 2 v). The pres. is used since the act is not completed. The ‘historical pres.’ is not Homeric.

- ἔβαν [**“ἔβησαν”**] ἄγοντες: cf. “ἔβαν φέρουσαι Β 302, βῆ φεύγων Β 665. οἴχομαι” is more freq. thus used with a partic., cf. “Β 71, οἴχεσθαι προφέρουσα θύελλα Ζ 346, οἴχεται ἵππον ἄγων Ψ” 577. See on vs. 138, 168.

- [**392**] “δόσαν κτλ”.: as v. 162, see on v. 124.

- [**393**] παιδὸς ἑῆος: thy valiant son. For “ἑῆος”, see § 20 e. It seems part of the poet's naïveté that the heroes apply such epiths. to themselves; but the phrase is part of the poet's stock, and he hardly thinks whether he is applying the epith. himself or is putting it in the hero's mouth.

- [**394**] Δία_: for the length of the ultima before “λίσαι”, see § 41 j.

- εἴ ποτε: cf. v. 39, also vs. 503 ff.

- καλέσασα: by calling, coincident in time with “ὑπελύσαο”.

- [**403**] Βριάρεων: by transfer of quantity for “Βριάρηον”, § 5 d. The name (Heavy-handed, cf. “βριαρός”) marks his strength and character. He is called “Αἰγαίων” (Stormy, cf. “αἰγίς, Αἰγαί, Αἴγινα”) in the popular speech, as a sea divinity. He is the personified might and roar of the sea. Hesiod (Theog. 714) makes him aid Zeus against the Titans. — Homer attributes to the language of the gods names which are going out of use (but which may seem clearer in meaning than the others), cf. 2.813 f., “Ξ 291, ποταμὸς βαθυδίνης”, \| “ὃν Ξάνθον καλέουσι θεοί, ἄνδρες δὲ Σκάμανδρον γ” 73 f., “κ 305, μ” 61.

Achilles's words, “ὔφρα δ̓ ἐγὼ μετ̓ Ἀχαιοῖσιν πολέμιζον”, \| “οὐκ ἐθέλεσκε μάχην ἀπὸ τείχεος ὀρνύμεν Ἕκτωρ Ι” 352 f. as long as I was fighting among the Achaeans, Hector was not willing to rouse the battle away from the wall (of the city).

There were Aethiopians in the southeast and southwest of the Homeric world, “ἔσχατοι ἀνδρῶν, α” 22 ff. They are represented as a godfearing people, enjoying the personal intercourse of the divinities, 23.205 ff., Od. 5.282; cf. the presence of the gods at the sacrifices of the Phaeacians, Od. 7.201 ff.

- ἠώς: day, as “Φ 80, Ω” 413.

- ἄλλων: of all, lit. in comparison with the rest; ablatival gen., as with the comp. (where it marks the starting point of the comparison).

Cf. et genua amplexus, genibusque volutans \| haerebat Verg. Aen. iii. 607 f. For the form of “ἐμπεφυυῖα”, see § 31 a.

- εἴρετο: asked, as she demanded a ‘yes’ or ‘no.’

Thus even now in Greece, negation is indicated by an upward motion of the head, and affirmation by a downward nod (with an inclination toward the left).

- [**515**] ἀπόειπε: speak out plainly, as Od. 1.373; refuse is implied in the context.

- ἔπι: i.e. “ἔπεστι”, § 37 c. — “Thou hast nothing to fear.”

- αἰεί: exaggerated, cf. vs. 541, 561.

- [**522**] νοήοῃ: sc. that Thetis had been with him.

Aen. ix. 106, x. 115. — Phidias embodied in his colossal chryselephantine statue of Zeus at Olympia, the expression of exalted peace and power which lies in vs. 528-530. Zeus's dread of Hera's reproaches is in marked (and almost ludicrous) contrast to this majestic demeanor.

- [**534**] ἐξ ἑδέων: from their seats. Each god had his separate dwelling on Olympus, vs. 607 f., and his special seat in the hall in which they gathered. “ἕδος” is strictly not seat (“ἕδρη”) but place where the seat stands. — “σφοῦ κτλ.:” proleptic, with “ἄνεσταν”, they rose and went to meet their father. Motion is implied in the connection, as below. — This mark of respect is noted both negatively and affirmatively. — When Hera returns to Olympus, the gods “ἰδόντες ι πάντες ἀνήιξαν, καὶ δεικανόωντο δέπασσιν Ο” 85 f. — “οὐδὲ κτλ”.: a formula occurring nine times at the close of a verse.

- [**546**] εἰδήσειν: parallel form of “εἴσεσθαι”, § 34 k.—“χαλεποὶ κτλ”.: sc. “εἰδέναι”. The pers. const. is used as v. 589, “ῥηίτεροι πολεμίζειν ἦσαν Ἀχαιοί Σ” 258 the Achaeans were easier to fight with, “χαλεποὶ δὲ θεοὶ φαίνεσθαι ἐναργεῖς Υ” 131. H. 944.

- 551 = “Δ 50, Π 439, *<*>ς 360, Υ” 309.

- βοῶπις: ox-eyed; with deep, dark, majestically quiet eyes. This epith., like “λευκώλενος” v. 55, is almost peculiar to Hera; it is applied to two mortal women, “Γ 144, Η” 10, and to one nymph, 18.40,—all in passages suspected of interpolation.

- 552 = “Δ 25, Θ 462, Ξ 330, Π 440, Σ” 361.

- [**555**] After the rather harsh reply of Zeus, Hera plays one trump card after another, showing that she knew not only the person concerning whom she had asked (v. 540) but also what Thetis had requested, and what Zeus had promised.

- παρείπῃ: should persuade, i.e. lest it prove true that she has persuaded; anxiety about a fact of the past, for which the aor. ind. is used in “δείδω μὴ δὴ πάντα θεὰ νημερτέα εἶπεν ε” 300, but cf. “ἐξελθών τις ἴδοι μὴ δὴ σχεδὸν ὦσι κιόντες ω” 491.

- 556 = v. 538.—This is not spoken out of special animosity to Thetis, for whom in fact Hera had special affection; Hera claims Thetis as a sort of foster-child, “ἢν ἐγὼ αὐτὴ ι θρέψα τε καὶ ἀτίτηλα καὶ ἀνδρὶ πόρον παράκοιτιν Ω” 59 f. whom I myself bred and cherished and gave as wife etc. According to a myth found in Pindar (Isth. viii. 30 ff.) and Aeschylus (Prom. 906 ff.), both Zeus and Poseidon strove together as rivals for the love of Thetis, but bestowed her upon Peleus on learning from Themis that this goddess of the sea was destined to bear a son mightier than the father.

- πολέας: “πολλούς”, see § 20 f.

- Ἀχαιῶν: const. with “νηυσίν” (not “πολέας”), as is indicated by the order of words, and by the freq. repetition of the phrase “ἐπὶ νῆας Ἀχαιῶν”, v. 12, 2.8, 17, 168.

- [**561**] “αἰεὶ κτλ”.: always art thou thinking. An echo of the “ὀίω” of v. 558, showing vexation; cf. “αἰεί” v. 107.

- οὐ: closely connected with the verb.

- χραίσμωσιν: ward off.

- [**567**] ἆσσον ἰόντα: him who comes near, implying injury or attack. The acc. follows “χραίσμωσιν” on the analogy of “χραισμέω τινί τι, Η” 143 f., “ὣς ἄρα τοῖς οὔ τις δύναται χραισμῆσαι ὄλεθρον Λ 120, νήπιος, οὐδέ τί οἱ χραισμήσει λυγρὸν <*>῎λε-” “θρον Υ” 296.—“ὅτε . . . ἐφείω [**ἐφῶ”, cf. “ἐρείομεν” v. 62]: this explains “ἆσσον ἰόντα”, cf. “ποτιδέγμενον” (awaiting) “αἰεὶ ι λυγρὴν ἀγγελίην, ὅτ̓ ἀποφθιμένοιο πύθηται Τ” 336 f.—For the thought, cf. vs. 588 ff., 15.16 ff., 164 ff.

- [**577**] καὶ αὐτῇ περ: with Homeric refinement, the speaker intimates that his counsel is not needed.

- [**578**] αὖτε: i.e. as often before.

- ἡμῖν: dat<*>. of disadvantage.

- [**580**] εἴ περ: if only.

- ἐθέλῃσιν: the verb for emphasis here precedes its subj., see § 1 j; or “Ὀλύμπιος κτλ”. can be taken as in appos. with the subj. of “ἐθέλῃσιν”.—“Ὀλύμπιος κτλ”.: indicates his exalted power, although in v. 609 this expression is used without special reference to the circumstances of the case.

- ἀστεροπητής: for Zeus as god of the lightning and storm, see on 2.146.

- [**581**] ἐξ ἑδέων: see on v. 534.—The conclusion of the sent. is omitted (“ἀποσιώπησις”): “it will be the worse for us,” or “he can, for,” etc. See on v. 136.

- [**582**] καθάπτεσθαι: always metaphorical, as here. Inf. for the imv. as v. 323.

- φερόμην: is freq. used of ships driven by the wind, and marks the motion as involuntary.

- καταδύντι: the aor. partic. is here used (without reference to time as past, present, or future) of an act coincident with “κάππεσον”.

- [**593**] ἐν Λήμνῳ: for the dat. of rest after a verb of motion, cf. 3.89; see G. 191, N. 6; H. 788. Hephaestus had his workshop on Olympus, 18.369 ff., but Lemnos was considered his island, —a belief to which the volcanic mountain Mosychlos gave rise.

- θυμός: anima.—At another time, apparently when an infant, Hephaestus was cast out of heaven by his mother, and saved by Thetis, 18.395 ff.—cf. ‘Nor was his name unheard or unador'd \| In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land \| Men call'd him Mulciber; and how he fell \| From heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove \| Sheer o'er the crystal battlements; from morn \| To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve, \| A summer's day; and with the setting sun \| Dropt from the zenith like a falling star, \| On Lemnos, the Aegean isle.’ Milton Par.

- [**598**] οἰνοχόει νέκταρ: cf. (“Ἥβη”) “νέκταρ ἐῳνοχόει Δ 3, νέκταρ οἰνοχοεῦσα” Sappho Frag. 5; the meaning of the first part of the compound was overlooked; cf. “ἵπποι βουκολέοντο Υ 221, οἰκοδομεῖν τεῖχος”, aedificare naves, ‘tin box,’ ‘weekly journal.’

See on v. 37. The throne was covered with thin plates of gold.

- Zeus prepares to fulfil his promise to Thetis (1.509 f., 523) by sending a dream to Agamemnon.
