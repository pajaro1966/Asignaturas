• Alternative PFs

Unlike the simple verb, each compound can exhibit an additional PF where the third argument is promoted to the second position as an affected object (versions b): (i) συν-οικοδομέω promotes the Source or Instrument (1b), (ii) περι-οικοδομέω, παρ-οικοδομέω, and δια-οικοδομέω promote the Path (2-4b) to that position; and (iii) ἐν-οικοδομέω and κατ-οικοδομέω promote the Location (5b). In this second type of PFs (versions b), the compounds are not creation verbs and do not mean **anymore** ‘to build’, but (i) ‘to join’ (συν-οικοδομέω), (ii) ‘to surround’ (περι-οικοδομέω), ‘to narrow, to keep it off by a wall’ (παρ-οικοδομέω), ‘to build across, wall off, barricade’ (δια-οικοδομέω), and (iii) ‘to cover the inner part of, block up’ (ἐν-οικοδομέω) and ‘to cover with’ (κατ-οικοδομέω). In the versions 2-5b, there may appear a dative Instrument third argument referring to an entity which corresponds to the prototypical affected object (τείχει ‘with a wall’, B, example 13) or to the component element (C, λίθῳ ‘with stone’, example 27, σανίσι ‘with planks’) of versions ‘a’. This third entity can also be indirectly referred to by other clause constituents (ἐργαστήρια κατασκευαζόμενος ‘building’, example 17).

Therefore, preverbs introduce alternations in the sense of Levin (1993), since their compounds share **a** PFs with the simple verb and introduce a new PF with the same participants in a new syntactic configuration.

• Unselected Objects

A particularly interesting feature of the alternative PFs exhibited by the compounds (1b-5b) is that they allow the inclusion as objects of entities that do not comply with the selection restrictions imposed by the simple verb (unselected objects), as in the following English examples:*1*

• Analysis

One important question is whether we should consider (i) that the preverbs are added to the simple verbs and operate on them modifying their valence or (ii) that the preverbs present their own PFs and the simple verbs are just added to them to indicate the manner of action (‘by building’) whereby the SoA depicted by the preverb takes place, as proposed by Lewandowski & Mateu (2014, 1230-1232):

(i)	1a: συν-οικοδομέω ‘to build (οἰκοδομέω) in such a way that B is created as the union (συν-) of two or more entities’
	1b: ‘to build (οἰκοδομέω) in such a way that C1-Cn end up together (συν-)’

(ii)	1a: συν-οικοδομέω ‘to compose the entity B (συν-) out of two or more entities (C1-Cn) by building (οἰκοδομέω)’
	1b: ‘to join C1-Cn (συν-) by building (οἰκοδομέω)’

The second analysis has the advantage of explaining more economically why many compounds derived from semantically and syntactically different simple verbs can present the same PFs.
