<h1 id="odisea-comentario">Odisea, comentario<a class="headerlink" href="#odisea-comentario" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Homer's Odyssey. W. Walter Merry. James Riddell. D. B. Monro. Oxford. Clarendon Press. 1886-1901.</p>
<h2 id="book-9">Book 9 (ι)<a class="headerlink" href="#book-9" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The narrative of Odysseus, contained in bb. 9-12, was called, as early as the time of Plato, 'Ἀλκίνου ἀπόλογος' or 'ἀπόλογοι', i. e. 'the story told to Alcinous.' Plato quotes the title in Rep.614 B, where he introduces the myth of Er the Armenian—a story like the 'Νέκυια' in Od.11—as being not 'Ἀλκίνου γε ἀπόλογον, ἀλλ᾽ ἀλκίμου μὲν ἀνδρός'. Aristotle also uses the same phrase in Rhet.3. 16. 7, and Poet. 16. 5; though, as Mayor remarks, his reference is rather to b. 8. vv. 83-95, and 521-534. The time of the action of this book is the evening of the second day after the arrival in Scheria. The words of Odysseus from vv. 1-15 refer back to what Alcinous had said in b. 8. 536 foll. At v. 16 he complies with the request in 8. 550 'εἴπ᾽ ὄνομα'.
3, 4. ἦ τοι … αὐδήν. These lines are repeated from Od.1. 370 Od., 1.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[<strong>5</strong>] τέλος implies 'realisation' or 'consummation.' It means rather the 'highest perfection' of a thing than the 'end:' as we see from the phrase 'ἦμαρ τέλεσ᾽ Ἠώς' Od.5. 390; cp. also 'τέλος γάμοιο' Od.20. 74, 'τέλος θανάτοιο', etc. In a similar sense 'τέλειος' is used, as in 'τελειότατος πετεηνῶν' Il.8. 247, of most decisive augury. In the later language of philosophy, 'τὸ τέλος', like the Lat. 'finis bonorum,' came to mean the 'chief good.' But 'τέλος' does not imply so much as that here, as Schol. Q. V. remarks, 'οὐ παντὸς δὲ βίου τὴν ἡδονὴν τέλος εἴρηκεν ἀλλὰ συμποσίου τινός'. Plato, Rep.390B, censures the whole passage for its sensual tone; and so Lucian, Parasit. c. 10; but Eustath. says rightly that Odysseus is not here propounding a philosophy, but only chiming in with the opinion expressed by his host in 8. 248.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>6</strong>] ἔχῃ κατὰ δῆμον ἅπαντα. It would seem as if the direct object to 'ἔχῃ' was not expressed, but alluded to instead, under its constituent parts: 'when joy possesses [a people**] through all its individuals.' Such an interpretation might be paralleled by the phrases 'θαύμαζον κατὰ δῶμα' Od.4. 44, 'τόφρα γὰρ ἂν κατὰ ἄστυ ποτιπτυσσοίμεθα μύθῳ' Od.2. 77.Others take ἔχῃ κατά as a mere inversion for 'κατέχῃ', as in 'φυγὼν ὑπὸ νηλεὲς ἦμαρ', but the simplest way is to render 'ἔχῃ', 'holds' or 'reigns,' intransitively, as in Eur. I. A.10'σιγαὶ δ᾽ ἀνέμων'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'τόνδε κατ᾽ Εὔριπον ἔχουσι'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>11</strong>] τοῦτό τι, lit. 'this thing in a sort of way.' This is no hyperbaton for 'τοῦτο κάλλιστόν τι φαίνεται εἶναι', but a qualification of the general tone of the assertion by the addition of 'τι', as in such combinations as 'σχεδόν τι, πάνυ τι'. Cp. Il.21. 101'τόφρα τί μοι πεφιδέσθαι ἐνὶ φρεσὶ φίλτερον ἦεν'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Τρώων', Il.9. 197'ἦ τι μάλα χρεώ'. Nitzsch compares Hdt.4. 52</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'οὕτω δή τι ἐοῦσα πικρή'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>12</strong>] σοὶ δ᾽ ἐμά, 'but thine heart is set on asking me about my woeful troubles.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>13</strong>] ἔτι μᾶλλον. As he would do in renewing the memory of the 'κήδεα στονόεντα'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>14</strong>] τί πρῶτόν τοι. There is no need to read with a few MSS. 'τί πρῶτον, τί δ᾽ ἔπειτα', for the word ἔπειτα merely introduces a new stage in the action (see note on Od. 1.65); 'What shall I tell thee 'then' first?' In the next line, the emphasis lies on πολλά. It is the multitude of the sorrows he has had which makes it hard for him to know in what order to recount them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>17</strong>] εἴδετε and (18) ἔω are both subjunctives after 'ὄφρα'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>19</strong>] εἴμ᾽ Ὀδυσεύς. Virgil imitates this in Aen.1. 378'Sum pius Aeneas, fama super aethera notus.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ὃς πᾶσι … μέλω. It is not easy to decide whether πᾶσι belongs in the sense of 'παντοίοις' to δόλοισιν or to ἀνθρώποισι. The latter is supported by 'Ἀργὼ πᾶσι μέλουσα' Od.12. 70, but the former seems settled by Od.3. 121'ἐπεὶ μάλα πολλὸν ἐνίκα δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'παντοίοισι δόλοισι'. Cp. Theogn. 245 'οὐδέ ποτ᾽ οὐδὲ θανὼν ἀπολεῖς κλέος ἀλλὰ μελήσεις' 'ἄφθιτον ἀνθρώποις αἰὲν ἔχων ὄνομα'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>21</strong>] Ἰθάκην εὐδείελον. For the interpretation of this passsge see Appendix on Ithaca.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>24</strong>] ὑλήεσσα^ Ζάκυνθος. See note on Od. 1.246, where also we have 'ὑλήεντι Ζακύνθῳ' and not 'ὑληέσσῃ'. Similarly 'ἠμαθόεις' is used as an adjective of two terminations in fifteen places, 'ἀμπελόεις' in Il.2. 561, 'ποιήεις' ib. 503, the reason being probably merely metrical; see note on Od. 4.406.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>27</strong>] κουροτρόφος, generally rendered 'nurse of young heroes,' like 'βωτιάνειρα', an epithet of Phthia, Il.1. 155.But the translation of κουροτρόφος will be modified by the special meaning assigned to 'κοῦρος', and if we take 'κοῦρος' simply to mean a 'youth,' the compounded adjective may be compared with 'παιδοτρόφος', a Sophoclean epithet for 'ἐλαία', O. C.701.κουροτρόφος is also used of Latona, mother of Artemis and Apollo, in Theocr. 18. 50.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>28</strong>] ἧς γαίης, 'one's own land;' so inf. 34. On this the Schol. remarks 'οὐκ εἶπεν 'ἐμῆς' ἵνα καθολικώτερος γένηται ὁ λόγος'. For this use of the possessive or reflexive pronoun with other persons than the third cp. the v. l. 'δώμασιν οἷσιν' Od.1. 402 note. This freedom of usage is illustrated by the formation of the person-endings of the passive voice of the Lat. verb, if we hold that amor = amo-se.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>29</strong>] αὐτόθι, defined by the words 'ἐν σπέσσι γλαφ'. So Il.9. 617'σὺ δ᾽ αὐτόθι λέξεο μίμνων'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'εὐνῇ ἐνὶ μαλακῇ'. Cp. Od.4. 362.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>31</strong>] ὣς δ᾽ αὔτως, the regular collocation in Homer for the later 'ὡσαύτως δέ'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>32</strong>] Αἰαίη. The island where Circe lived is also called 'Αἰαίη' in Od.10. 135.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>34</strong>] ὥς = adeo. A general sentiment, the result of the special instances that precede, is thus introduced by 'ὥς' in Od.11. 427'ὣς οὐκ αἰνότερον καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο γυναικός', similarly with 'οὕτως' in Od.8. 167.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>37</strong>] εἰ δ᾽ ἄγε. See note on Od. 1.276.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ἐνίσπω is the subjunctive, as in Il.22. 381'εἰ δ᾽ ἄγετ᾽ ἀμφὶ πόλιν σὺν τεύχεσι πειρηθῶμεν'. More commonly 'εἰ δ᾽ ἄγε' is followed by the imperative, but cp. Od.21. 217; 24.337.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>38</strong>] ἀπὸ Τροίηθεν. So 'ἀπ᾽ οὐρανόθεν' Od.11. 18.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>39</strong>] Κικόνεσσι. The Cicones, called 'αἰχμηταί' Il.2. 846, lived on the south coast of Thrace, between the rivers Hebrus and Lissus. In historical times they are found on the Hebrus, Hdt. 7. 57, 110. Ismarus, their town, lay at the foot of a mountain of the same name. Cognate with this word, Ismarus, is the name of the priest Maron, inf. 197, and Maroneia, the late name of the Ciconian city, near Lake Ismaris, Hdt.7. 169.For the dative Ἰσμάρῳ, in apposition with, and more closely defining, 'Κικόνεσσι' cp. Hom. Od.8. 362'Κύπρον ἵκανε . . ἐς Πάφον'. The Thracians were allies of Troy ( Hom. Il.2. 846), which accounts for the burning of their city by a Greek hero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>40</strong>] αὐτούς here makes a strong contrast with πόλιν. Cp. Od.14. 265.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>42</strong>] μή τίς μοι, 'that no one, as far as I could help it, should go away deprived of a fair share;' for ἴση see on Od. 1.97. For the use of μοι in the sense given in the translation, like the later 'ἐμοῦ γ᾽ ἕνεκα', cp. Plato, Rep.343A, where Thrasymachus expresses a doubt whether Socrates has a nurse ('τίτθη') to look after him, because he is left in such a state of drivelling ignorance, 'ὅτι τοί σε, ἔφη, κορυζῶντα περιορᾷ καὶ οὐκ ἀπομύττει δεόμενον, ὅς γε αὐτῇ οὐδὲ πρόβατα οὐδὲ ποιμένα γιγνώσκεις', where 'αὐτῇ' means 'for aught she teaches you.' Cp. ib. 391 D; Theaetet. 143</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>43</strong>] διερῷ. See on Od. 6.201.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>46</strong>] ἔσφαζον, sc. 'οἱ ἑταῖροι', who are the subject to 'ἐπίθοντο' sup. So we find inf. 54 'ἐμάχοντο'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>47</strong>] Κίκονες Κικόνεσσι. See Od.1. 313; 3.272; 10.82; 20. 173.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>49</strong>] ἤπειρον, i.e. 'inland,' contrasted with the Cicones of Ismarus, who were 'παραθαλάσσιοι'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ἀφ᾽ ἵππων, not 'from horseback,' but 'from the war-chariot.' Similarly 'ἵππων ἐπιβήτορες' Od.18. 263.The sentence is in a concentrated form. Written out fully it would run, 'ἐπιστάμενοι μὲν ἀφ᾽ ἵππων ἀνδράσι μάρνασθαι, ἐπιστάμενοι δὲ ἐκεῖ πεζοὶ μάρνασθαι ὅθι χρή τινα πεζὸν ἐόντα μάρνασθαι'. For an antithesis given by 'μὲν . . καί' compare Il.1. 267'κάρτιστοι μὲν ἔσαν καὶ καρτίστοις ἐμάχοντο'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>50</strong>] With πεζὸν [σξ. τινά**] ἐόντα compare Od.11. 159; 19.221. The more natural arrangement would have been to make the words 'ὅθι χρή' parenthetical, and write 'πεζοὶ ἐόντες', as the parallel to 'ἀφ᾽ ἵππων', but the force of 'χρή' seems to break up the sentence, and to introduce the accusatival construction. They know then 'how to fight from the chariot, and how to fight on foot in that part of the battle where one ought to do so.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mayor collects instances of heroes having to leave their chariots and fight afoot; viz. Il.3. 29; 4.419; 5.594; 11. 48, 211; 12. 176; 16. 426. Compare also Caesar de Bell. Gall.4. 33.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>51</strong>] ὥρῃ, 'in their season.' Cp. inf. 135; Od.17. 176.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>52</strong>] ἠέριοι, 'in the morning.' Some connect this with 'ἀήρ' as referring to the morning mists; others to 'ἦρι', which stands to 'ἠ-έ-ριος' as 'αὔξω' to 'ἀ-έ-ξω'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>54</strong>] στησάμενοι … μάχην ( Il.18. 533), 'having set the battle in array.' Cp. 1 Sam.17. 2. So 'φυλόπιδα στήσειν' Od.11. 314, 'στήσασθαι πολέμους' Hdt. 7. 9, 175, 236. It seems better to adopt this construction, for although 'ἐμάχοντο μάχην' may be joined, as in Il.15. 414(compare also Il.12. 175; 15. 673, both lines of doubtful authority), στησάμενοι can hardly stand alone, for its use is uniformly transitive; compare 'στήσασθαι κρητῆρας' Od.2. 431, Il.6. 528, 'ἱστόν' Il.1. 480, inf. 97, 'ἀγῶνα' h. Hom. Ap. 150. But it is still better to make μάχην the object both of the participle and the verb, as inf. 'κλῖναν δαμάσαντες Ἀχαιούς'. The full subject to ἐμάχοντο and βάλλον includes both the Cicones and the men of Odysseus; this explains ἀλλήλους. In πάθοιμεν the reference is limited to Odysseus and his men only; as also in μένομεν.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>58</strong>] μετενίσσετο. The preposition expresses the changed course of the sun after he has passed the zenith: up to this point his course is regarded as a rise ('ἀέξετο ἦμαρ'); afterwards it is regarded as a descent; cp. Od.11. 18; 12.381. The Sun-God is a charioteer, 'τὸν αἰπὺν οὐρανὸν διφρηλατῶν' Soph. Aj.845, and at the end of the day's work he unyokes his steeds, as the ploughman unyokes his oxen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>βουλυτός, sc. 'καιρός', is 'the time for unyoking oxen.' Cp. 'Sol ubi . . iuga demeret bobus fatigatis' Hom. Od.3. 6. 42. In Homer only the adverbial compound 'βουλυτόνδε' is found, here and Hom. Il.16. 779.Before the division of the day into hours we find frequent instances of these graphic phrases to denote particular portions of time. Thus, in Hom. Il.11. 84 foll., the Trojans and Greeks are represented as contending all the morning with varying success, 'ἦμος δὲ δρυτόμος περ ἀνὴρ ὡπλίσσατο δεῖπνον', . . . 'τῆμος . . . Δαναοὶ ῥήξαντο φάλαγγας'. Again, in Hom. Od.12. 439, the planks that had been sucked down the whirlpool re-appear at supper-time, 'ἦμος δ᾽ ἐπὶ δόρπον ἀνὴρ ἀγορῆθεν ἀνέστη' . . 'τῆμος δὴ τά γε δοῦρα Χαρύβδιος ἐξεφαάνθη'. One such phrase, 'πληθούσης ἀγορᾶς', continued in use in far later times. Milton uses a similar expression in 'Comus'— ' 'Two such I saw, what time the laboured ox In his loose traces from the furrow came, And the swink'd hedger at his supper sat.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>' The corresponding phrase for morning is given by Hesiod, Opp. 581 'ἠὼς . . πολλοῖσιν ἐπὶ ζυγὰ βουσὶ τίθησιν' .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>60</strong>] ἓξ ἀφ᾽ ἑκάστης. Crates interprets this to mean nothing more than seventy-two in all: there were twelve ships (inf. 159), which would give an average of six from each ship. Zoilus, called 'Ὁμηρομάστιξ', was offended at the suspicious symmetry involved in giving exactly six to each ship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>63</strong>] ἄσμενοι ἐκ θανάτοιο, repeated inf. 566, 'glad to have escaped death.' The full expression is given in Il.20. 350'φύγεν ἄσμενος ἐκ θανάτοιο'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>64</strong>] οὐδ᾽ ἄρα μοι προτέρω, 'yet, for all that' ('ἄρα', see Od.1. 346), 'I let not my ships sail on, till we had thrice called to each one of our poor comrades.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>65</strong>] The subject to ἀῦσαι is 'τινα', expressing, distributively, all the remainder of the crews. For a similar use of 'τις' compare Il.2. 355'πρίν τινα πὰρ Τρώων ἀλόχῳ κατακοιμηθῆναι'. The Ambrose Schol. says, 'ἀρχαῖον ἔθος ἦν τῶν ἐπὶ ξένης ἀπολλυμένων τὰς ψυχὰς ἐκ τρίτου ἀνακαλεῖν. τοῦτο δὲ ἐγίνετο ἵνα, εἴ τις ὑπολίποιτο ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ, προσέλθοι'. Eustath. adds, 'ἤδη δὲ καὶ ἵνα μή τις ζῶν καὶ ἐπικρυπτόμενος διὰ τοὺς πολεμίους καταλειφθείη ἐκεῖ, καὶ τοῦτο μὲν Ὁμηρικόν'. But this interpretation is condemned by the words 'οἳ θάνον ἐν πεδίῳ'. Nitzsch is careful to distinguish the 'τρὶς ἀῦσαι' from 'valedictio,'—the 'verba novissima' of Aen.6. 231; but it is difficult not to regard it as a similar religious act, though possibly less formal. The interpretation of Schol. H. suits the passage well, 'τῶν ἀπολομένων ἐν ξένῃ γῇ τὰς ψυχὰς εὐχαῖς τισὶν ἐπεκαλοῦντο ἀποπλέοντες οἱ φίλοι εἰς τὴν ἐκείνων πατρίδα, καὶ ἐδόκουν κατάγειν αὐτοὺς πρὸς τοὺς οἰκείους'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>70</strong>] ἐπικάρσιαι. Eustath. interprets this 'head downwards,' of ships plunging their bows in the seas as they run before the wind, comparing the word with 'ἐπικάρ',</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'χαράδραι … μεγάλα στενάχουσι ῥέουσαι ἐξ ὀρέων ἐπικάρ' Il. 6. 392 ('praeceps'). An analogous form is 'ἀνακάρ'. Nitzsch prefers the interpretation of Apoll. ' λεχ.πλάγιαι' = 'obliquae.' Compare the expression 'ἐπικαρσίας τοῦ Πόντου' of ships moored at an angle to the Euxine, Hdt.7. 36; and the word 'ἐγκάρσιος', 'athwart,' Thuc.6. 99.The ships are regarded as drifting on with the wind abeam. The radical meaning of 'κάρσιος' in these compounds is, according to Düntzer, 'curved' or 'crooked;' compare 'κέρας, κυρτός'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>74</strong>] συ_νεχές. The quantity of the first syllable in 'συνεχές' and 'πα_ρέχῃ', Od.19. 113, is long, because 'ἔχω' originally had initial 'ς', cp. 'ἕξω, ἔσχον'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>75</strong>] θυμὸν ἔδοντες, cp. Cicero, Tusc. Disp. 3. 26 ''ipse suum cor edens.'' See also Od.10. 143, 379; Il.6. 202. In Od.16. 92 we find 'καταδάπτειν ἦτορ', and in Il.24. 129'σὴν ἔδεαι κραδίην'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>79</strong>] ἀσκηθής, according to Döderl. equivalent to 'ἄσκαστος', from 'ἀ' and 'σκάζω'. Others refer it to Skt. root kSa. Compare our 'un-scathed.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>80</strong>] Μάλειαν, see on Od. 3.287; 4. 514. The proverb, 'After doubling Malea forget your home,' quoted by Strabo (8. 218), points to the dangers of the sea off that cape. Compare also ''formidatum Maleae caput'' Stat. Theb. 2. 33.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The north-west wind caught Odysseus as he was doubling Malea, and drifted him past Cythera (Cerigo): he had intended to pass between the cape and the island. The same thing befel Jason with his Argonauts, Hdt.4. 179'καί μιν ὡς πλώοντα γενέσθαι κατὰ Μαλέην ὑπολαβεῖν ἄνεμον βορέην καὶ ἀποφέρειν αὐτὸν πρὸς τὴν Λιβύην'. It is an obvious conjecture that the Lotophagi occupied some place on or off the north coast of Africa, but the locality intended was, even in ancient times, a subject of doubt. Herodotus joins the Lotophagi with other African tribes, as the Nasamones, Garamantes, and Gindanes, and places them in the neighbourhood of the Syrtes, Hdt.4. 177'ἀκτὴν δὲ προέχουσαν ἐς τὸν πόντον τούτων τῶν Γινδάνων νέμονται Λωτοφάγοι'. Pliny, N. H. 5. 44, says, ''in intimo sinu (Syrtidis maioris) fuit ora Lotophagon,'' and similarly Mela , de situ orb. 1. 7. Scylax, in his Peripl.§ 110 ed. Müll., is very distinct, 'τὰ δὲ ἔξω τῆς Σύρτιδος παροικοῦσι Λίβυες Λωτοφάγοι ἔθνος μέχρι τοῦ στόματος τῆς ἑτέρας Σύρτιδος: οὗτοι λωτῷ χρῶνται σίτῳ καὶ ποτῷ'. Strabo 17. 3. 17, puts them in the island of Meninx (Gerbi or Zerbi), 'τὴν δὲ Μήνιγγα νομίζουσιν εἶναι τὴν τῶν Λωτοφάγων γῆν, τὴν ὑφ᾽ Ὁμήρου λεγομένην: καὶ δείκνυνταί τινα σύμβολα καὶ βωμὸς Ὀδυσσέως καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ καρπός. πολὺ γάρ ἐστι τὸ δένδρον ἐν αὐτῇ τὸ καλούμενον λωτόν'. The island of Meninx was called by Ptolemy 'Λωτοφαγῖτις'. The general result of the various views is to place the Lotus-eaters' land somewhere near the little Syrtis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>84</strong>] ἄνθινον, 'vegetable.' Böthe suggests 'ἀκάνθινον' from Polybius' description of the Lotus shrub, 'δένδρον οὐ μέγα, τραχύ, ἀκανθῶδες' (Polyb. 12. 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>89</strong>] ἐπὶ χθονὶ σῖτον ἔδοντες, used here merely to characterise human beings, as in Il.5. 347, where the expression serves to draw the distinction between gods and men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>94</strong>] This λωτός is not to be confounded with the grass of that name, Il.2. 775; Od.4. 602; Il.14. 348. Hdt.4. 177 describes the Lotus as follows, 'ὁ δὲ τοῦ λωτοῦ καρπός ἐστι μέγαθος ὅσον τε τῆς σχίνου ῾μαστιξ-βερρψ̓, γλυκύτητα δὲ τοῦ φοίνικος τῷ καρπῷ ῾τηε δατἐ προσείκελος: ποιεῦνται δὲ ἐκ τοῦ καρποῦ τούτου οἱ Λωτοφάγοι καὶ οἶνον'. With 'γλυκύτητα' we may compare the expression μελιηδέα καρπόν here. Modern travellers state that the fruit is used at the present day for food, on the north coast of Africa and far inland, and in these parts it is called Jujuba. Polybius gives a further description of the shrub (12. 2. ed. Bekk.), 'ἔστι δὲ τὸ δένδρον οὐ μέγα, τραχύ, ἀκανθῶδες, ἔχει δὲ φύλλον χλωρόν, παραπλήσιον τῷ ῥάμνῳ, μικρῷ βαθύτερον καὶ πλατύτερον. ὁ δὲ καρπὸς τὰς μὲν ἀρχὰς ὅμοιός ἐστι τῇ τε χρόᾳ καὶ τῷ μεγέθει ταῖς λευκαῖς μυρτίσι ταῖς τετελειωμέναις. αὐξανόμενος δὲ τῷ μὲν χρώματι γίγνεται φοινικοῦς, τῷ δὲ μεγέθει ταῖς γογγύλαις ἐλαίαις παραπλήσιος. πυρῆνα δ᾽ ἔχει τελέως μικρόν . . ἔστι δὲ τὸ βρῶμα παραπλήσιον σύκῳ καὶ φοινικοβαλάνῳ, τῇ δ᾽ εὐωδίᾳ βέλτιον'. Theophrastus, Plant. Hist. 4. 3, distinguishes the Cyrenaic Lotus from that used by the Lotophagi; the latter was 'γλυκύς, ἡδὺς καὶ ἀσινής', and grew in such abundance in those parts, that the army of Ophellas on its march to Carthage subsisted on Lotus alone for some days. Mungo Park mentions the existence of a tree in the interior of Africa, the fruit of which was called by the negroes Tomberug, which they dried, pounded, and made into sweet cakes. Miquel (Hom. Flor. 19) seeks to identify the Lotus of Homer with the dudaim ('mandrakes' in Eng. vers.) which Reuben brought to his mother Leah, Gen. 30. 14.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>96</strong>] βούλοντο … μενέμεν, 'would rather remain;' cp. Il.1. 117, and Od.3. 124.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>97</strong>] ἐρεπτόμενοι. The word is used elsewhere of brutes feeding, Il. 2. 776; 5. 196. Here it is used of men, as is 'χορτάζεσθαι' sometimes, because they are eating, or as it were 'browsing' on, 'ἄνθινον εἶδαρ'. The connection of ἐρέπτεσθαι with 'ἐρείπειν' implies a ravenous way of eating; so a river is said 'κονίην ὑπερέπτειν ποδοῖιν' Il.21. 271.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice here the contrast between present and aorist in μενέμεν and λαθέσθαι, the latter implying the instant abandonment of all thought of return, the former the continuous sojourn in the Lotus-eaters' land.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>98</strong>] τοὺς μέν, 'them I proceeded to bring away forcibly to the ships, weeping; and in the hollow ships, dragging them under the thwarts, I made them fast.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>99</strong>] νηυσὶν ἐνί forms an antithesis to ἐπὶ νῆας. I took them to the ships, and 'when I had got them there,' etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The space ὑπὸ ζυγά was esteemed a secure place; Odysseus stows there the presents given him by Alcinous, Od.13. 21, and treasures are hidden there; cp. Eur. Cycl.144 'ἐν σέλμασιν νεώς ἐστι' .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>102</strong>] μή πως must be read here instead of 'μή πω'. We find 'μή πως' used in Homer twenty-five times with optative and subjunctive moods; 'μή πω' only four times, Il. 17. 422; 18. 134; Od. 22. 431; 23. 59; and in each case with an imperative. For the use of the subjunctive after a past tense (κελόμην … λάθηται) cp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Ζεὺς ἐγγυάλιξε σκῆπτρόν τ̓ ἠδὲ θέμιστας, ἵνα σφίσι βουλεύῃσθα' Il. 9. 98, and Od.8. 579.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>106</strong>] Κύκλωπες. Hesiod , or his interpolator, Theog. 144, makes this name mean 'round-eyed,' as if from 'κύκλος' and 'ὤψ'. It is impossible to suppose, with Göttling, that the name contains an allusion to the round walls and buildings of the so-called 'Cyclopean' architecture. If we accept the derivation from 'κύκλος' or 'κυκλόω' we may see in the word some connection with a nature-myth; the round central eye symbolising the sun or eye of the universe. Döderl. proposes to derive 'κύκλωψ' by a sort of reduplication from 'κλέπτειν' and 'κλώψ', and to make the name of a race of robbers or brigands. The Homeric Cyclopes must be carefully distinguished from the Hesiodic (Theog. 139 foll.). Hesiod represents them as children of Uranos and Gaea, who fashion the thunderbolts for Zeus at their forge. They symbolise the powers of fire, and their home is placed in or on Mount Aetna. The Homeric Cyclopes are regarded by some com mentators as personifying the wild and turbulent forces of the sea. This belief is supported by the fact that Polyphemus is presented to us as a son of Poseidon by the daughter of Phorkys; but Preller (Griech. Mythol. vol. 1. p. 513) carries this notion much too far, when he seeks in the αἶγες ἀπειρέσιαι (118) an allusion to the leaping waves (cp. 'ἐπ-αιγ-ίζειν', etc.). The ancients generally placed the home of the Cyclopes in Sicily ( Thuc.6. 2), and in the neighbourhood of Aetna; while modern commentators have located them on the south or west coast of the island. But, surely, throughout these books we are in a wonder-land, which we shall look in vain for on the map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>107</strong>] θεοῖσι πεποιθότες. Comparing this statement with 'οὐ γὰρ Κύκλωπες Διὸς αἰγιόχου ἀλέγουσιν οὐδὲ θεῶν μακάρων' inf. 275, it is evident that there is no notion of devoutness here implied, but a simple and careless confidence in the bounty of nature, saving them all trouble for maintenance. Cp.'ἡ γῆ δ᾽ ἀνάγκῃ, κἂν θέλῃ κἂν μὴ θέλῃ, τίκτουσα ποίαν τἀμὰ πιαίνει βοτά' Eur. Cycl. 333, and the account given by Herodotus of the Scythians (4. 19) 'νομάδες ἤδη Σκύθαι νέμονται, οὔτε τι σπείροντες οὐδὲν οὔτε ἀροῦντες'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>111</strong>] σφιν … ἀέξει, sc. 'οἶνον', 'makes it grow for them.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>114</strong>] θεμιστεύει, 'is lord and master over.' Cp. Aristot. Eth.10. 10. 13, where he is speaking of the freedom that law does not reach, 'καὶ ζῇ ἕκαστος ὡς βούλεται κυκλωπικῶς θεμιστεύων παίδων ἠδ᾽ ἄλοχου'. The reading 'ἀλόχου' there is remarkable as a v. l.; probably the common reading ἀλόχων does not intentionally express the notion of polygamy, but is assimilated in number and sound to 'παίδων'. Cp. also Plat. Pol.1. 2.§ 7 'πᾶσα γὰρ οἰκία βασιλεύεται ὑπὸ τοῦ πρεσβυτάτου . . καὶ τοῦτ᾽ ἔστιν ὃ λέγει Ὅμηρος 'θεμιστεύει δὲ ἕκαστος παίδων ἠδ᾽ ἀλόχων'.' Plato, de Legg. 680, quotes this description of the Cyclopes as an illustration of the earliest form of family government, in which men were 'πατρονομούμενοι καὶ βασιλείαν πασῶν δικαιοτάτην βασιλευόμενοι'. There is a sort of irony in describing the Cyclopes as knowing no 'θέμιστες', but 'θεμιστεύει ἕκαστος'. Laws imply Society: the Cyclopes are a law to themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>116</strong>] ἔπειτα, 'now,' merely marking the transition from one part of the description to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>λάχεια. The reading 'ἔπειτ᾽ ἐλαχεῖα [ἐλάχεια'**] is distinctly stated to have been that of Zenodotus, which probably implies that Aristarchus adopted the v. l. 'λάχεια', in which he is followed by Eustath. Apoll. Lex. Hom. and Etym. Magn. λάχεια is referred by the Scholl. to 'λαχαίνω', and interpreted by 'εὔγεως' and 'εὔσκαφος'. Nitzsch understands it to mean 'rough,' that is, 'overgrown with brushwood and scrub,' connecting it with such words as 'λάχνη' and 'λάχανον', and 'λαχύφλοιος' Alex.1. 269, or 'λαχειδής' ibid. 581; but against this we have 'ἄροσις λείη' inf. 134. Döderl. refers the word to the root 'λεχ', and understands by it 'lowlying.' But it is very doubtful if the 'ε' could change to 'α.' The reading 'ἐλάχεια' ('ἐλαχύς') the Schol. translates by 'βραχεῖα', which some commentators (Hesych. Etym. Magn. 558. 10) find incompatible with the idea of length suggested by τετάνυσται. Perhaps Döderlein's rendering might reconcile the two interpretations if 'βραχεῖα' be an antithesis not so much to 'μακρά' as to 'ὑψηλή': cp. Od.10. 509.Bekk. reads 'ἐλάχεια' here, and so does Baumeister in h. Hom. Ap. 197 'τῇσι μὲν οὔτ᾽ αἰσχρὴ μεταμέλπεται, οὔτ᾽ ἐλάχεια', 'ἀλλὰ μάλα μεγάλη τε ἰδεῖν', spoken of Artemis; here there seems a distinct contrast between 'ἐλάχεια' and 'μεγάλη'. Those who endeavour to localise all this scene in Sicily look for the island in some one of the Aegates Insulae off Cape Lilybaeum. Cluver decides for one of them, viz. Aegusa, as satisfying the Homeric description. The comma is best placed after Κυκλώπων, though some editors put it after τετάνυσται, so making the genitive depend upon the adverbs σχεδόν and ἀποτηλοῦ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>120</strong>] εἰσοιχνεῦσί μιν, 'enter it,' sc. 'νῆσον'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>κυνηγέται is used only in this passage, the general words in Homer for huntsmen being 'θηρητῆρες' and 'ἐπακτῆρες', cp. Il.17. 135.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>122</strong>] ἀρότοισιν, 'with tillage,' used by a zeugma with καταΐσχεται. The plural ἀρότοισι may be explained by such Homeric usages as 'τεκτοσύναι', Od.5. 250, for 'carpentry,' 'ἱπποσύναι', etc. καταΐσχεται, a poetical form for 'κατίσχεται' = 'is occupied,' 'filled.' So Il.16. 79'οἱ δ᾽ ἀλαλητῷ' 'πᾶν πεδίον κατέχουσι'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>125</strong>] μιλτοπάρῃοι. The same epithet is given to the ships of Odysseus, Il. 2.637.Cp. Hdt.3. 58'τὸ δὲ παλαιὸν ἅπασαι αἱ νῆες ἦσαν μιλτηλιφέες'. Probably 'μίλτος' is cinnabar, an ore of mercury from which vermilion is made; it must have been one of the oldest pigments in use as the cinnabar mines of Almaden in Spain are said to have been worked nearly 2500 years. We find also as epithets of ships 'κυανόπρῳροι' inf. 539, and 'φοινικοπάρῃοι' Hom. Od.11. 124.Here 'μιλτοπάρῃοι' is used only as a standing epithet, and does not imply that the Cyclopes had ships, though not red ones. Translate, 'For the Cyclopes have no red-prowed ships by them, nor are any men in their country shipwrights, who might make them strongbenched ships, which should perform all their purpose, travelling to the cities of men, as oftentimes men cross the sea in ships to visit one another— craftsmen, who would have wrought their island also into a fair settlement.' We find καμεῖν used as a direct transitive with the sense of 'making' only in the aorist; as 'μίτρην κάμον' Hom. Il.4. 187, 'πέπλον' Hom. Il.5. 735; Hom. Od.15. 105, 'ὅπλα' Hom. Il.18. 614, 'ἵππον' (wooden horse) Hom. Od.11. 523, 'λέχος' Hom. Od.23. 189. In four passages the combination 'κάμε τεύχων' occurs with accusative (Hom. Il.2. 101; 7. 220; 8. 195; 19. 368), in which cases 'τεύχειν' is the governing verb. The verb 'κάμνειν' is common in this sense in the later Epicists, as Apoll. Rhod. and Smyrn. See La Roche, Hom. Stud. 183.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>128</strong>] οἷά τε πολλά, as in Od.8. 160; 11.536. Very similar is the use of 'οἷά τε' by itself, Od.3. 73, etc., or simply 'οἷα' Od.8. 365.The construction is a sort of cognate or adverbial accusative with the verb, as in such phrases as 'τόδ᾽ ἱκάνεις' Od.10. 75, 'τόδε χώεο' Od.5. 215.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>130</strong>] ἐυκτιμένην (cp. Od.24. 226'ἐυκτιμένῃ ἐν ἀλωῇ') is used predicatively with ἐκάμοντο. We must take καί closely with νῆσον, for the sentence implies that the craftsmen would have directed their work, partly towards building ships, and also ('καί') towards cultivating the island.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>131</strong>] ὥρια. This is explained in the words of Xenophon, Oecon.16. 5'ὅσαπερ οἱ θεοὶ ἐν ταῖς ὥραις ἀγαθὰ παρέχουσι' Oecon., i. e. 'in due season.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>132</strong>] πολιοῖο. See note on Od. 4.406.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ὄχθας is used only here of the sea; generally it means river-banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>134</strong>] ἄροσις λείη, 'smooth ploughing land.' So in Il.9. 579 we have a description of a 'τέμενος . . τὸ μὲν ἥμισυ οἰνοπέδοιο',</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'ἥμισυ δὲ ψιλὴν ἄροσιν πεδίοιο ταμέσθαι'. Mayor compares aratio from Cic. Phil.2. 101, and Milton's use of the word 'tilth.' αἰεὶ εἰς ὥρας, to be taken closely together; the latter clause being qualificative of the former—'always, as the seasons come.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>135</strong>] ἐπεὶ μάλα πῖαρ ὑπ᾽ οὖδας, 'since very rich soil spreads below the surface.' For ὑπό with the accusative in such a signification cp. 'ὑπ᾽ αὐγάς' Od.2. 181, 'ὑπ᾽ ἠῶ ἠέλιόν τε' Il.5. 267, 'οὔτε γὰρ ὕπεστι οἰκήματα ὑπὸ γῆν' Hdt.2. 127.See also Hom. Od.22. 362; 24. 234. Some take πῖαρ as an adjective agreeing with οὖδας, regarding it as a neuter to 'πίων', of which the irregular feminine is 'πίειρα'. In this case it would be necessary to write ὕπ̓ = 'ὕπεστι'. But it is better to follow Buttm. in making 'πῖαρ' a substantive, as 'βοῶν ἐκ πῖαρ ἑλέσθαι' Hom. Il.11. 550.Cp. h. Hom. Ap. 60 'ἐπεὶ οὔ τοι πῖαρ ὑπ᾽ οὖδας'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>136</strong>] πεῖσμα. According to the Schol. 'ἀπόγειον σχοινίον ᾧ πείθεται ἡ ναῦς'. The derivation, according to Curtius, is found in the Skt. root bandh, whence badh-nA-mi, 'flecto,' 'ligo,' and Gk. 'πενθ-ερός'. But Schol. is so far right that πεῖσμα is properly the 'ἀπόγειον σχοινίον', for it is generally employed as an equivalent for 'πρυμνήσια'. Cp. Od.13. 77'πεῖσμα δ᾽ ἔλυσαν ἀπὸ τρητοῖο λίθοιο'. Here it is used for mooring-tackle generally, subdivided into the cable from the bows fastened to the 'εὐναί', and the 'πρυμνήσια' between the stern and the shore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>138</strong>] μεῖναι. From the negative 'οὐ χρεώ ἐστι', we must supply the corresponding affirmative 'χρεώ ἐστι' = 'it is possible,' or rather 'all that is needful is.' Cp. Od.18. 145'ὃν οὐκέτι φημὶ φίλων καὶ πατρίδος αἴης'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'δηρὸν ἀπέσσεσθαι, μάλα δὲ σχεδόν', sc. 'εἶναί φημι'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>140</strong>] ἐπὶ κρατός, Schol. 'τῆς ἀρχῆς', 'the head of the harbour.' See Od.13. 102.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>141</strong>] ὑπὸ σπείους, 'forth from under.' For ὑπό in this sense with genitive cp. Od.4. 39; 5.320; 7. 5, etc.; also in composition, as 'θάμνων ὑπεδύσετο' Od.6. 127.For the form see note on 5. 68.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>143</strong>] ὀρφναίην, according to Curtius connected with 'Ὀρφεύς' and 'ἔρεβος', and, perhaps, with 'ἐρέφω'. It is not a standing epithet of 'νύξ', but refers specially to this misty night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>προὐφαίνετο, used impersonally; 'nor was there light enough to see;' and thus they needed the gods' guidance. In a similar sense 'φαείνω' is used, as Od.18. 307'λαμπτῆρας ἵστασαν ὄφρα φαείνοιεν'. Also 'προὔφαινε', 'gave forth light,' inf. 145, but in Od.12. 394 used transitively, 'προὔφαινον τέραα'. Cp. Aen.3. 585 foll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>147</strong>] οὔτ᾽ οὖν κύματα. It is easy to alter 'οὔτε' to 'οὐδέ' on the ground that 'οὔτε' is usually the correlative of another 'οὔτε'. But the reading may well be retained on the ground that an οὔτε is implied, though not expressed, before νῆσον, i. e. 'οὔτε νῆσον οὔτε κύματα'. So Od.11. 483'οὔ τις ἀνὴρ προπάροιθε μακάρτατος οὔτ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ὀπίσσω', Il.22. 265'ὣς οὐκ ἔστ᾽ ἐμὲ καὶ σὲ φιλήμεναι, οὔτε τι νῶιν'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'ὅρκια ἔσσονται'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>149</strong>] κελσάσῃσι νηυσί. We should more naturally expect a genitive absolute, but the case here used is a sort of dativus commodi, as if he had said 'the ships had their sails taken down by us.' Cp. Hdt.4. 134 'τεταγμένοισι δὲ τοῖσι Σκύθῃσι λαγὸς ἐς τὸ μέσον διήιξε'. For a similar dative with 'καθαιρεῖν' cp. Il.11. 452 'οὐ μὲν σοί γε πατὴρ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'ὄσσε καθαιρήσουσι θανόντι περ'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>151</strong>] ἀποβρίξαντες, 'having fallen asleep.' 'βρίζειν', connected with 'βρίθειν' and 'βαρύς', is properly to be 'heavy with sleep.' Cp. Theocr. Ep. 21'θαρ-' 'σέων καθίζευ κἂν θελῃς ἀπόβριξον'. So Opp. Cyneg. 3. 511, on the wakefulness of hares: ' οὔ ποτε γὰρ δὴ ὕπνον ἐπὶ βλεφάροισιν ἀποβρίξαντες ἕλοντο'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>153</strong>] ἐδινεόμεσθα, 'roamed;' cp. Od.16. 63'φησὶ δὲ πολλὰ βροτῶν ἐπὶ ἄστεα δινηθῆναι'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'πλαζόμενος'. With the verb κατ᾽ αὐτήν is to be closely taken, 'αὐτήν' serving to contrast the island itself with the shore and the water.</p>

<li>
<p>[<strong>156</strong>] δολιχαύλους. The 'αὐλός' was a metal ferule or collar by which the spear-head was attached to the shaft; cp. Il.17. 297'ἐγκέφαλος δὲ παρ᾽ αὐλὸν ἀνέδραμεν ἐξ ὠτειλῆς'. The epithet only means that the spear was 'long;' the emphasis lies on 'δολίχος', the other part of the word merely gives a feature common to all spears. See note on 'δένδρεον ὑψιπέτηλον' Od.4. 458.</p>

<p>[<strong>160</strong>] λάγχανον, a solitary instance in Homer of 'λαγχάνειν' meaning 'to fall by lot.' If we read αἶγας with Vind. 56, we should have the regular construction with 'λαγχάνειν', 'they got nine goats by lot:' this reading would necessitate the v. l. 'ἐν δὲ ἑκάστῃ'. In Eur. Hel.213 we have 'αἰὼν δυσαίων ἔλαχε', but there 'σέ' is probably to be supplied from the preceding line, so that the accusative will be like Il.23. 78'ἐμὲ μὲν κὴρ'. . 'λάχε γεινόμενόν περ'. Still, in Plat. Legg. 745 we find 'τὸ λαχὸν μέρος'. The MSS. vary between 'ἐν δὲ ἑκάστῃ' and 'ἐς δὲ ἑκάστην'. If the former be preferred, we may justify it by such a construction as 'οἶνον ἀφύσσειν ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσι'. ἔξελον, 3rd person plur. If it were the 1st person, it would be 'ἐξελόμην', as the meaning would be, 'I took for myself.' 'ἐξαιρεῖν' in the active is 'to choose something for somebody else;' as when Priam chose the best of his treasures as a ransom for his son, 'δώδεκα μὲν περικαλλέας ἔξελε πέπλους' Il.24. 229; cp. Od.21. 56; 22.110. The person on whose behalf the choice is made stands in the dative case, as Il.1. 369; 16.56; 18.444; Od.7. 10.See La Roche, Hom. Stud. 234.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>167</strong>] αὐτῶν refers to the Cyclopes in contrast to the flocks. The meaning of the addition ἐγγὺς ἐόντων is that they judged of the nearness of the land by being able to hear voices and see the smoke.</p>

<li>
<p>φθογγήν is joined with ἐλεύσσομεν by a sort of zeugma. Cp. S. c. T. 160 'κτύπον δέδορκα', Aesch. P. V.21'ἵν᾽ οὔτε φωνὴν οὔτε του μορφὴν βροτῶν ὄψει'. Mayor refers to Lobeck, Rhemat. 329 foll., for illustrations of this sort of confusion in the use of words relating to the bodily senses.</p>

<p>[<strong>184</strong>] μῆλα, the lesser cattle, including sheep and goats. The etymological connection of the word is very uncertain. It may be connected with 'μαλακός' in the sense of 'soft' or 'woolly,' a notion which suggests a further reference to 'μαλλός'. If we might compare the word with 'μα_λός', 'bright' (compare 'μήλοπα καρπόν' [?**] Od.7. 154), we should have an etymology which would equally suit 'μῆλον', 'the apple' or 'bright-cheeked fruit,' and 'ἄργυφα μῆλα', the 'bright white flocks.' Grimm J. refers 'μῆλα' = 'the lesser cattle' to the same root as 'small.'</p>

<p>αὐλή. The cave penetrated back into the interior of the cliff, but round the mouth of it was a yard ('αὐλή'), surrounded by high stone walls of 'Cyclopean' architecture, and along the walls a row of trees. See on Od. 6.267. The αὐλή seems to have had a huge door, as well as the 'ἄντρον', but cp. inf. 239. The trees had been, as it were, worked into the wall, the stonework being brought close up to the standing trunks. The massive stone architecture of early Greece was, probably in allusion to this passage, attributed to the Cyclopes. Pausanias (2. 16), speaking of the ruins of Mycenae, and especially the Lion-gate there, says, 'They affirm that these were the work of the Cyclopes, who also made for Proetus the walls of Tiryns.' See Eurip. I. A.153'ἐπὶ Κυκλώπων ἱεὶς θυμέλας', on which Strabo (8. 6) says that the Cyclopes accompanied Proetus on his return from Asia. and that he 'τειχίσαι τὴν Τίρυνθα διὰ Κυκλώπων: οὓς ἑπτὰ μὲν εἶναι καλεῖσθαι δὲ γαστεροχείρους, τρεφομένους ἐκ τῆς τέχνης [̣], ἥκειν δὲ μεταπέμπτους ἐκ Λυκίας. καὶ ἴσως τὰ σπήλαια τὰ περὶ τὴν Ναυπλίαν καὶ τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς ἔργα τούτων ἐπώνυμά ἐστι'. And even a later and more elaborate kind of masonry still kept the same appellation. Cp. Fur. Eur. Herc.15'Ἀργεῖα τείχη καὶ Κυκλωπίαν πόλιν', ib. 944 'τὰ Κυκλώπων βάθρα'</p>

<li>
<p>[<strong>189</strong>] ἀθεμίστια ᾔδη. Sometimes we find 'οἶδα' used with the genitive when the notion of experience is present, e. g. 'τόξων εἰδώς' Il.12. 363, 'τεκτοσυνάων' Od.5, 250, in such a connection generally with the addition of 'εὖ' or 'σάφα'. Where knowledge (scientia）rather than experience is implied, an accusative commonly follows, as in the phrase 'μήδεα' or 'πεπνυμένα μήδεα εἰδώς, δίκας εἰδώς' Od.2. 38; 9.215; 'παλαιά τε πολλά τε εἰδώς' Od.2. 188; 7.157; 24.51. Often the neuter plural of an adjective is used with 'εἰδώς' to express the character or disposition, and to imply consequently the habits and practice. This usage with the participle, as e. g. 'κεδνὰ ἰδυῖα' Od.1. 428, 'λυγρὰ ἰδυῖα' 11. 432, 'φίλα εἰδώς 3. 277, ὀλοφώια εἰδώς 4. 460, ἀπατήλια εἰδώς' 14. 288, is peculiar to the Odyssey. The use of the neuter adjective with the finite verb, as here, is also found in Il.5. 326; 15.207; 16.73; 24. 41; Od.13. 405. It is like the later use of the adjective with 'φρονεῖν', which is actually found in Il.6. 162'ἀγαθὰ φρονέοντες' = 'with right mind;' different in sense from 'ἀγαθὰ φρονέων' in Od.1. 43.Here we may translate 'of lawless mood;' or, following the language of the Psalms, 'with his mind set upon unrighteousness.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>192</strong>] ὅ τε. It seems better to read, with Wolf, 'ὅ τε φαίνεται' = 'quod quidem apparet,' than 'ὅτε' = 'quum.' Cp. Schol. Q. 'πλείστας δὲ παραβολὰς ποιεῖται τοῦ μεγέθους αὐτοῦ. διὸ καὶ ὄρει ἄνθρωπον εἴκασεν ὡς ὑπερβάλλοντα παντὸς ζῴου μέγεθος, καὶ οὐδ᾽ ὄρει ἁπλῶς ἀλλὰ ῥίῳ ὑλήεντι, ὅ ἐστιν ὄρει τῷ ὑψηλοτέρῳ καὶ τούτῳ ὑλήεντι: τοῦτο δέ ἐστιν ὑπερβολὴ ὑπερβολῆς'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>197</strong>] Μάρων is called son of Dionysus in Eur. Cycl.141. According to the Schol. on Apoll. Rhod. 3. 996, it is Euanthes who is son of Dionysus and Ariadne.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>198</strong>] ἀμφιβεβήκει, 'used to protect,' cp. Il.1. 37'ὃς Χρύσην ἀμφιβέβηκας'. It is not necessary to force ἀμφιβεβήκει here into the sense of a present tense, or to read, with Nitzsch, 'ἀμφιβέβηκε'. The tense refers back to the time before the destruction of Ismarus. For as a god could not resist the 'ἀνάγκη' of fate, he would desert a city when the sentence of its doom had gone forth. Cp. S. c. T. 218 'ἀλλ᾽ οὖν θεοὺς' 'τοὺς τῆς ἁλούσης πόλιος ἐκλείπειν λόγος'. See also Virg. Aen.2. 351; Hist. 5. 13'Apertae delubri fores et audita maior humana vox excedere deos.' Plin. N. H. 28. 2. 4 ''In oppugnationibus ante omnia solitum a Romanis sacerdotibus evocari deum cuius in tutela id oppidum esset.'' The notion of protection in 'ἀμφιβαίνειν' comes through that of 'walking round it,' 'patrolling,' etc.; especially of a hero protecting a corpse or a wounded friend on the battle-field. In this sense it is commonly used with a personal dative, as Il.17. 4'ἀμφὶ δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ αὐτῷ βαῖν̓, ὥς τις περὶ πόρτακι μήτηρ' 'πρωτοτόκος κινυρή', cp. Il.5. 299; 14.477; 17.359. In the same sense we have the substantive 'ἀμφίβασις' Il.5. 623, and 'περιβαίνειν' ib. 21 etc. The latter word is a good illustration of περισχόμεθα in the next line, which means literally, 'hold ourselves round,' used with a personal genitive in Il.1. 393'ἀλλὰ σὺ, εἰ δύνασαί γε, περίσχεο παιδὸς ἑῆος'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>202</strong>] τάλαντα. The same word is used in Homer for scales and weights; nor must we suppose here that 'τάλαντον' is anything more than a definite weight: 'rerum mutatione omnis fere tunc temporis mercatura constabat, ex pondere aestimabantur omnia, nec signatis nummis indigebant. Boum numero maius vel minus rei pretium definiebant: eadem ratione metalla aestimata sunt ( Il.2. 449; 6. 236), auri quoque talenta saepius collaudat H., de quibus in diversa abierunt viri docti. Quae quidem talenta nec signata nec proprie ita dictam monetam fuisse mea fert sententia. In auro argento aliisve metallis ponderandis proprius fuit talenti usus, qua voce generatim pretium sive pondus, quibuscunque tandem rebus, bobus potissimum aliave pecude solvendum seu adpendendum significarent' Terpstra, Hom. Antt. 99 foll. We can form very little idea of the value of gold in Homeric times. In Il.6. 235, gold arms, as bartered against bronze, are represented by the value of 100 oxen against 9, which would make gold worth 11 1/9 times the value of bronze. In Il.23. 757 the lowest prize in a foot race is half a talent of gold. The chief tains of Phaeacia give Odysseus a cloak and shirt each, and one talent of gold, Od.8. 392; the reward given by Aegisthus to the sentinel was two talents, Od.4. 527; the two talents of gold in the law court represented on the shield of Achilles ( Il.18. 507) may have been either a prize or a deposit. Two talents are the fourth prize in the chariot races, Il.23. 269; and among the conciliatory offerings from Agamemnon to Achilles ten talents of gold are mentioned, Il.9. 122, and the same amount as part of the ransom given by Priam for Hector's body, Il.24. 232, and as a portion of the gifts of the Aegyptian Polybus to Menelaus. But no real approach can be made towards the valuation of the talent of gold in early times. The utmost we can say is that possibly, from a comparison of Il.23. 269, 750, 805, we may gather that the worth of an ox was two talents of gold. But this value must have varied infinitely according to the relative scarcity of oxen or gold; see Buchholz, Hom. Real. vol. 2. p. 300 foll.</p>

<p>[<strong>204</strong>] δυώδεκα πᾶσιν. See on Od. 5.244.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>206</strong>] ἀμφιπόλων, always used in Homer of female servants. The duties of 'ἀμφίπολοι' comprised spinning and weaving, Il.6. 323; Od.1. 357; 7.235; attendance at meals (especially to pour water over the diners' hands), Od.1. 136, etc., and general household work, Il.22. 442; Od.7. 232.They commonly accompanied the lady of the house or her daughter, Od.1. 331; 6. 84, etc. The corresponding male servants are the 'θεράποντες'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>209</strong>] ἓν δέπας. It was customary in the earliest times to pour the wine into the water, and not, as later, the water into the wine. Cp. Od.7. 164.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ἓν δέπας ἐμπλήσας is just equivalent to the Latin past participle, 'unum poculum impletum;' as, inf. 340, 'ἐπέθηκε θυρεὸν μέγαν ὑψόσ᾽ ἀείρας' would be represented by 'obicem magnum sursum sublatum admovit.' Translate, then, 'He poured one full cup of wine into twenty measures of water.' For the use of ἀνά to express 'distribution' compare 'ἀν-έμισγε δὲ σίτῳ'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'φάρμακα λυγρά' Od.10. 235, 'ἀνὰ δὲ κρῖ λευκὸν ἔμιξαν' Od.4. 41.Nitzsch compares Xen. Anab.3. 4. 21'ἓξ λόχους ἀνὰ εἴκοσι ἄνδρας'. In Pliny's time the wine of Maroneia kept something of its ancient fame, the proportion of the water with this wine in common use being eight to one, ''sextarios singulos octonis aquae'' N. H. 14. 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>214</strong>] ἐπελεύσεσθαι. That ἄνδρα is subject to the infinitive, and not object, as Nitzsch prefers, seems settled by the use of 'ἐπῆλθε' inf. 233. The idea instantly came into his mind that the man who would meet them would be a huge and mighty creature, who would want his wine to be strong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ἐπιειμένον ἀλκήν. Here and Il.7. 164; 8.262; 18.157. In Il.1. 149; 9. 372, we have 'ἀναιδείην ἐπιειμένος'. A similar metaphor occurs in 'δύναμιν περιθεῖναι' [not 'παραθεῖναι'**] Od.3. 205.Cp. Isaiah 50. 17.</p>

<p>[<strong>216</strong>] οὐδέ μιν … εὕρομεν. For οὐδέ with the force of 'ἀτὰρ οὐ' see on 'οὐδὲ βίηφιν' inf. 408; Od.5. 88.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>219</strong>] The ταρσοί mentioned here are the same as the πλεκτοὶ τάλαροι inf. 247. The Schol. says rightly 'ταρσοὶ δὲ λέγονται παρὰ τὸ τέρσαι, ὅ ἐστι ξηρᾶναι'. In Eur. Cycl.208 they are called 'σχοίνινα τεύχη'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>τυρῶν βρῖθον, 'were loaded with cheeses.' The same construction occurs in Od.15. 334, but the verb is used with the dative in Od.6. 159; 16.474; 19.112; Il.18. 561.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>στείνοντο is found with the dative inf. 445 and Il.21. 220.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>221</strong>] ἔρχατο, in Od.10. 241 with augment, 'ἐέρχατο'. The lambs were penned off in three divisions according to age, the firstlings, the later lambs ('μέτασσαι' = 'intermediate,' from 'μετά', as 'ἔπισσος' from 'ἐπί' and 'περισσός' from 'περί',) and the newly yeaned. With the use of ἕρσαι, to express the young of animals, compare 'ψάκαλον' and 'μητέρες ψακαλοῦχοι' Soph. Frag. 962, and 'δρόσοις ἀέπτοις λεόντων' Aesch. Ag.141.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>222</strong>] ναῖον. The full form of the verb 'νάω' is 'σ-ναϝ-ω', Aeol. 'ναύω'. It is, together with 'νέω' (i. e. 'σ-νεϝ-ω', cp. 'ἔνευσα'), to be referred to root 'νυ' or 'σνυ', Skt. snu, and snau-mi = 'fluo.' The quantity of the 'α' in 'νάω' is usually short in Homer, as in Od.6. 292; Il.21. 197, but the v. l. 'νᾶον' gives 'α_' in the imperf., as in the later epic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general word ἄγγεα is subdivided into σκαφίδες ('σκάπ-τω', scoop), and γαυλοί, probably 'round bowls;' cp. 'γόγγυλος', and Skt. golas = 'a ball.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>225</strong>] αἰνυμένους ('ἡμᾶς') τυρῶν, 'that we should take some of the cheeses and go back again.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>229</strong>] εἴ μοι ξείνια δοίη. The use of εἰ in this connection is not uncommon, where there seems a want of some word like 'σκοπεῖν' or 'πειρᾶσθαι' to fill up the sense. Cp. inf. 267 'ἱκόμεθ᾽ εἴ τι πόροις ξεινήιον', Od.10. 147'ἀνήιον ἐς περιωπὴν',</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'εἴ πως ἔργα ἴδοιμι'. Similarly with 'αἴ κε', Il.10. 55'ἐπὶ Νέστορα δῖον' 'εἶμι καὶ ὀτρυνέω ἀνστήμεναι, αἴ κ᾽ ἐθέλῃσιν'  'ἐλθεῖν'. Cp. Il.6. 94; 11.796; 24.301; Od.1. 379; 2.144; 3.92; 4. 34.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>230</strong>] οὐδ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἔμελλε, 'yet, as it fell out, he was not going to be a joy to my comrades, when he showed himself.' For οὐδ᾽ ἄρα in a similar sense compare Il.1. 329'τὸν δ᾽ εὗρον παρά τε κλισίῃ καὶ νηὶ μελαίνῃ'
'ἥμενον οὐδ᾽ ἄρα τώ γε ἰδὼν γήθησεν Ἀχιλλεύς'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>231</strong>] ἐθύσαμεν, i. e. an offering to the gods of part of the cheeses, before they began to take them for themselves, cp. Od.15. 222 of Telemachus 'θῦε δ᾽ Ἀθήνῃ νηὶ πάρα πρύμνῃ'. Comparing this with ib. 258 we find 'θῦε' interpreted by 'σπένδειν'. Similarly Od.14. 446'ἄργματα θῦσε θεοῖς', and Il.9. 219'θεοῖσι δὲ θῦσαι ἀνώγει'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Πάτροκλον ὃν ἑταῖρον: ὁ δ᾽ ἐν πυρὶ βάλλε θυηλάς'. This agrees with the remark of the Schol. T. 'μέλλοντες ἐσθίειν πρότερον ἐθύσαμεν'. Lehrs (de Stud. Aristarch.82) gives as a rule ''θύειν' nusquam apud Homerum dicitur de immolanda hostia, sed de offerendis 'ἀπαρχαῖς', et 'θυηλαί' sunt 'ἀπαρχαί'.' See Athen. 5. 7 'καὶ πρὸ τοῦ θοινᾶσθαι δὲ ἃ δεῖ ποιεῖν ἡμᾶς διδάσκει πάλιν Ὅμηρος ἀπαρχὰς τῶν βρωμάτων νέμειν τοῖς θεοῖς: οἱ γοῦν περὶ τὸν Ὀδυσσέα, καίπερ ὄντες ἐν τῷ τοῦ Κύκλωπος σπηλαίῳ 'ἐνθάδε πῦρ κείαντες ἐθύσαμεν, ἠδὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ' 'τυρῶν αἰνύμενοι φάγομεν'.' The later Epicists did not maintain this accurate usage, as e. g. we have in Apoll. Rhod. 1. 420; 2. 156 'θυηλή' used of slaughtered victims, joined with the word 'ῥέζειν', the proper term for sacrificing. For a similar make-shift sacrifice, where water and not wine was used for the libation, and leaves were substituted for the 'οὐλοχύται' of meal, see inf. 12. 356 foll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>234</strong>] ποτιδόρπιον, 'that it might serve him [for light**] at supper,' 'ἵνα ἔχῃ πρὸς φῶς δειπνεῖν' Schol. H. Cp. 'ἐπὶ δόρπῳ' Od.18. 44.For a similar use of a compound adjective Nitzsch compares 'καταθύμιος' Il.17. 201, 'μεταδόρπιος' Od.4. 194, 'μεταδήμιος' Od.8. 293.The fuel seems only to have been used by the Cyclops to give light, as in Od.18. 307 we find cressets fed with billets of wood, 'αὐτίκα λαμπτῆρας τρεῖς ἵστασαν ἐν μεγάροισιν',</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'ὄφρα φαείνοιεν: περὶ δὲ ξύλα κάγκανα θῆκαν κ.τ.λ.' There is no allusion here to the use of fire for cooking; as, under ordinary circumstances, the Cyclops seems only to have eaten cheese and drunk milk. In the 'Cyclops' of Euripides however the monster is represented as feeding on the sheep which he pastured, 'γάλακτι καὶ τυροῖσι καὶ μήλων βορᾷ' (122), and as hunting with dogs, 'θῆρας ἰχνεύων κυσίν' (130), and as keeping horned cattle as well as sheep and goats; for Silenus offers to Odysseus 'βοὸς γάλα' (136).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>235</strong>] The Cyclops just enters the cave and throws down therein his bundle of firewood (ἔντοσθεν ἄντροιο); he then steps outside again and drives the ewes and she goats into the cave, leaving the rams and he-goats outside in the courtyard. Thus we can give a consistent picture by adopting the conjecture of H. Rumpf, ἔντοθεν αὐλῆς, instead of ἔκτοθεν. To make any sense of 'ἔκτοθεν' we must either, with Düntzer, regard 'αὐλή' as synonymous with 'σπέος', or, with Döderlein, take 'ἔκτοθεν' as nothing more than an epexegesis of 'θύρηφιν', in which case βαθείης αὐλῆς must be treated as a local genitive, equivalent to 'in the court.' See Monro, H. G. § 149, who seems to favour this, quoting 'αὐλῆς ἐκτὸς ἐών', Od.4. 678.The form 'ἔντοθεν' for the ordinary 'ἔντοσθεν' is given in Cramer. Ox. An.177. 31; Bekk. An.945. 22.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>240</strong>] θυρεόν, dissyll., is used in later Greek for 'a shield.' In Hdt.2. 96 a broad board is called 'θύρη'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>241</strong>] ἄμαξαι … ὀχλίσσειαν. Probably a hyperbolical parody of the proverbial expression in Il.12. 447'τὸν δ᾽ οὔ κε δὔ ἀνέρε δήμου ἀρίστω'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'ῥηιδίως ἐπ᾽ ἄμαξαν ἀπ᾽ οὔδεος ὀχλίσσειαν'. There seems to be something intentionally comic in the grave circumstantiality of the exact number twenty-two, and in the form of the expression; for it is not possible to conceive twenty-two waggons working together to lift a weight, and ὀχλίσσειαν can hardly express the sort of work done by a waggon, however accurately the word may be used for 'pushing' or 'heaving' a weight upon a waggon. In Il.13. 260 twenty-one is the number used to express a 'good many' spears; in Il.15. 678 a very long spear is 'δυωκαιεικοσίπηχυ', in Il.23. 264 a huge tripod is 'δυωκαιεικοσίμετρος'. Cp. also Il.22. 349'δεκάκις τε καὶ εἰκοσινήριτ᾽ ἄποινα', and Od.12. 78.From this passage may come the expression quoted in Bekk. Anecd. 24 'ἁμαξιαῖα χρήματα', i. e. 'μεγάλα ἃ φέροι ἂν ἅμαξα οὐκ ἄνθρωπος ἡ ὑποζύγιον', cp. Xen. Anab.4. 2. 3; Xen. Hell.2. 4. 27.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>243</strong>] ἠλίβατον. The use of the word here as an epithet of a stone block is conclusive against the etymology given by Apoll. Lex. Hom. 'ἥλιος' and 'βαίνειν', i. e. 'ἧς ὁ ἥλιος μόνον ἐπιβαίνει'. More likely is the derivation maintained by Buttm. on the suggestion of the Schol., 'ἣ ποιεῖ τινὰ ἀλιταίνειν τῆς βάσεως', which would make the word nearly equivalent to 'δύσβατος'. Others connect it with 'λέπας', root 'λιπ' in the sense of 'smooth,' 'sheer,' like 'λὶς πέτρη'. In h. Hom. Ven. 268 it is used as an epithet of pinetrees, but the line is suspicious.</p>

<p>[<strong>246</strong>] θρέψας, 'having curdled half the white milk, he set it down in wicker baskets, having collected it together.' With θρέψας in the sense of 'having thickened,' cp. 'τρόφι κῦμα' Il.11. 307. In Homeric times milk was curdled by stirring in the juice of the wild fig-tree, 'ὀπός' Il.5. 902.The later name for 'rennet' was 'πυετία', or, in Doric, 'τάμισος' Theocr. 7. 16.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>247</strong>] ἀμησάμενος. See on Od. 5.482.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>250</strong>] αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δή. If we throw the emphasis on σπεῦσε, we may render 'but when, having busied himself, he had despatched these works of his.' For 'σπεύδειν' with objective accusative see Il.13. 235; Od.19. 137, and with τὰ ἃ ἔργα cp. 'τὸν ἐμὸν γάμον' Od.2. 97.But it seems more likely that the important word is πονησάμενος, frequently used with an accusative, as in Il.9. 348; 18.380; 23.245; Od.15. 222, etc.; and σπεῦσε comes in with the same sort of adverbial force that 'τυγχάνω' or 'λανθάνω' give to a sentence. Translate, 'after he had quickly performed what he had to do.' Cp. Od.10. 249'ἀγασσάμεθ᾽ ἐξερέοντες' = 'asked in our surprise.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>251</strong>] πῦρ ἀνέκαιε. The fire that Odysseus and his companions had lighted, sup. 231, had, of course, been extinguished or suffered to smoulder, which would better suit with 'ἀνέκαιε'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>252-255. See on Od. 3.71-74.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>256</strong>] ἡμῖν … δεισάντων. See on Od. 6.156. Eustath. calls this construction 'ἐναλλαγὴ ἀπὸ δοτικῆς εἰς γενικήν'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>261</strong>] 'ἄλλην ὁδὸν, ἄλλα κέλευθα'. This repetition of 'ἄλλος' is generally taken as giving a sense like 'ἄλλυδις ἄλλῃ' inf. 458, and so taking up 'ἀποπλαγχθέντες' = 'on various ways and various wanderings.' But it seems simpler, following the interpretation of Schol. Q. ('ἐκ παραλλήλου τὸ αὐτό: τὰ γὰρ δύο ἓν σημαίνουσι'), to take the words as only meaning, 'a different route and a different journey,' sc. from the homeward direction. The use of 'ἄλλος' would then be a sort of euphemism for 'unfortunate;' cp. Il.23. 144; and perhaps 'ἑτέρως' in Od.1. 234.A similar meaning attaches to the Lat. 'secus,' in such phrases as 'si secus acciderit' Cic. Fam. 6. 21. 2, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>262</strong>] μητίσασθαι. This aor. and the fut. 'μητίσομαι' Il.3. 416, are found as from a pres. 'μητίομαι', a poetical form of 'μητιάω'. Similarly we have 'δηρίσαντο' Od.8. 76, and 'δηριόωντο' ib. 78, pointing to 'δηρίομαι' and 'δηριάομαι' respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>264</strong>] μέγιστον stands as predicate; 'his fame, far as the heaven covers, is the greatest.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>266</strong>] ἡμεῖς δ᾽ αὖτε, an antithesis to Agamemnon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>τὰ σὰ γοῦνα must be immediately governed by ἱκόμεθα, on the analogy of 'τὰ σὰ γούναθ᾽ ἱκάνομαι' Od.3. 92, and κιχανόμενοι may be rendered 'thus visiting thee,' as in Il.19. 289'νῦν δέ σε τεθνηῶτα κιχάνομαι'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>267</strong>] ξεινήιον πορεῖν is the most general expression for the bestowal of hospitality, δωτίνην is a more specific addition. The relative ἥ τε, which refers to both, is attracted to the gender of 'θέμις', cp. Od.24. 285'τῷ κέν σ᾽ εὖ δώροισιν ἀμειψάμενος ἀπέπεμψε'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'καὶ ξενίῃ ἀγαθῇ: ἡ γὰρ θέμις', with Il.11. 779'ξείνιά τ᾽ εὖ παρέθηκεν ἅ τε ξείνοις θέμις ἐστί'. For θέμις used in the sense of regular custom, like 'δίκη', cp. Il.9. 134'ἣ θέμις ἀνθρώπων πέλει'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>271</strong>] αἰδοίοισιν. This merely means that all guests are 'revered,' qua guests, and does not refer to the particular character of any individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>275</strong>] οὐ γὰρ Κύκλωπες. This is inconsistent with what the Cyclopes acknowledged about the power of Zeus, inf. 410; and with Polyphemus' boast that Poseidon was his father. But as a piece of impious boasting, such inconsistency is quite true to nature. On this braggadocio of Polyphemus the Schol. remarks, 'τὸ ἴδιον ἁμάρτημα ἑαυτοῦ ὁ Πολύφημος κοινὸν ποιεῖται: ὅτι γὰρ οἱ ἄλλοι Κύκλωπες οὐκ ἦσαν ἄθεοι, φησί, 'νοῦσον δ᾽ οὔ πως ἔστι Διὸς μεγάλου ἀλέασθαι'.' Cp. ' Ζηνὸς δ᾽ ἐγὼ κεραυνὸν οὐ φρίσσω, ξένε, οὐδ᾽ οἶδ᾽ ὅτι Ζεύς ἐστ᾽ ἐμοῦ κρείσσων θεός' Eur. Cycl.320.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>279</strong>] εἰπέ. 'Tell me where you moored your ship when you came here.' For ἔχειν νῆα in this sense cp. Od.10. 91; Hdt.6. 95.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of the participle ἰών merely as a graphic addition may be paralleled by similar usage in Attic, as 'ὅσην κατ᾽ αὐτὼν ὕβριν ἐκτίσαιτ᾽ ἰών' Soph. Aj.304.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>280</strong>] δαείω, subjunctive, see Monro, H. G., Append. C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>281</strong>] εἰδότα πολλά, cp. the epithet 'πολύμητις'. He means, 'with my knowledge of the world.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>282</strong>] ἄψορρον. The Schol. strangely interprets as 'οὐχ ἁπλῶς ἀλλ᾽ ὀπισθόρμητον, τὸ ἀνάπαλιν τῆς ἀληθείας'. It only means, 'I answered him back,' as in inf. 501.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>283</strong>] Νέα. See crit. note. For two short syllables coalescing into one long cp. 'ὑψηρεφε_α_' Od.4. 757, 'ἠνώγε_α_' sup. 44, 'τεμένε_α_' Od.11. 185, and 'ῥε_α_ διελεύσεσθαι' Il.13. 144.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>285</strong>] If we join ἄνεμος ἐκ πόντου we may compare it with 'πλημυρὶς ἐκ πόντοιο' inf. 486. Others join φέρεν ἐκ πόντου, 'brought in from the open sea;' i. e. they were driven on a leeshore, which explains the reason of their coming at all to the land of the Cyclopes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>288</strong>] Join ἐπὶ … ἴαλλε and σὺν … μάρψας. Cp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'φῶτε συμμάρψας δύω ἔσφαξ᾽ ἑταίρων τῶν ἐμῶν ῥυθμῷ τινὶ, τὸν μὲν λέβητος ἐς κύτος χαλκήλατον, τὸν δ᾽ αὖ τένοντος ἁρπάσας ἄκρου ποδὸς, παίων πρὸς ὀξὺν ὄνυχα πετραίου λίθου, ἐγκέφαλον ἐξέρραινε' Eur. Cycl.397. The cooking is a later refinement, not found in the Homeric story. Macrobius, 5. 13, referring to Virgil's treatment of the scene in Aen.3. 623, says ''Narrationem facti nudam et brevem Maro posuit; contra Homerus 'πάθος' miscuit, et dolore narrandi invidiam crudelitatis aequavit.''</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>291</strong>] Join διὰ … ταμὼν μελεϊστί, as Il.24. 409 'ᾗσι κυσὶν μελεϊστὶ ταμὼν προύθηκεν Ἀχιλλεύς'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>292</strong>] οὐδ᾽ ἀπέλειπεν stands as a parenthetical clause = 'without leaving anything;' ἔγκατα, etc., being directly governed by ἤσθιε. Cp. 'ὣς μένεν Ἰδομενεὺς δουρικλυτὸς' ('οὐδ᾽ ὑπεχώρει'),
'Αἰνείαν ἐπιόντα βοηθόον' Il.13. 476, 'καὶ βάλεν', ('οὐδ᾽ ἀφάμαρτε τιτυσκόμενος κεφαλῆφιν'), 'ἄκρην κὰκ κόρυθα' Il.11. 350 Il., 376.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>297</strong>] Join ἐπὶ … πίνων, and cp. Eur. Cycl.327 'ἐπεκπιὼν γάλακτος ἀμφορέα' , 'drinking on the top of it,' as we say 'to wash it down.' So 'θύννεια . . καταφαγὼν κᾆτ᾽ ἐπιπιὼν ἄκρατον οἴνου χόα' Ar. Eq.354; and in a somewhat similar usage 'ὅταν τὸ ὕδωρ πνίγῃ τί δεῖ ἐπιπίνειν;' Aristot. Eth. Nicom. 7. 2. 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of ἄκρητον shows that the common custom was to dilute milk with water; or, perhaps, to curdle the milk and drink only the whey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>298</strong>] διὰ μήλων. For διά with genitive expressing unbroken extension through the midst cp. Od.10. 391'ἡ δὲ δἰ αὐτῶν ἐρχομένη Od., 12. 206 διὰ νηὸς ἰών', ib. 335; 17. 161.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>301</strong>] ὅθι φρένες ἧπαρ ἔχουσι. Generally rendered, 'where the midriff enfolds the liver,' a sufficiently accurate description of the way in which the upper surface of the liver lies in the concavity of the diaphragm. Seiler, ad loc. gives a long note in favour of rendering ἔχουσι 'support,' because the diaphragm apparently supports the liver; in proof of which belief he quotes the anatomical term, 'Ligamentum suspensorium hepatis.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>302</strong>] χείρ᾽ ἐπιμασσάμενος. The acute accent is thrown back in consequence of elision, and so we have here 'χείῤ' for 'χειρί', as 'εἴφ̓' for 'εἰπέ' sup. 279. It is commonly taken to mean 'feeling, fingering, my sword,' as 'ξίφεος ἐπεμαίετο κώπην' Od.11. 531.But a more likely interpretation is 'feeling for it,' i. e. for the mortal spot near the liver, passing his hand in the dark over the monster's body till he found the place, where the breastbone ended and the soft parts would offer little resistance to the sword. Ameis, Anh. on Od. 19.480, quotes from Oppenrieder (de ii. Hom. loc. Comment. Augsburg, 1865) the statement that 'ἐπιμαίεσθαι' regularly has the sense of 'placide tangere' or 'leniter contrectare.' Comparing Od.4. 277; 8.196; 9. 441, 446; 11. 531; 13. 336; 14. 356 and 19. 468, 480, he decides in favour of this interpretation, adding, 'ad leniter tangendi et attrectandi significationem saepe accedit quaerendi et explorandi significatio, siquidem hoc cum alioquin tum imprimis in tenebris vel caecitate tangendo et contrectando fieri solet.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>θυμός, here in its most concrete sense, 'a second thought.' The Schol. T. interprets it here by 'λογισμός', but the word signifies not so much the result of calculation, as 'impulse,' as may be seen in such expressions as 'κέλεται δέ με θυμός'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>303</strong>] καὶ ἄμμες, i. e. 'we as well as he;' assassins and victim together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With ἀπολέσθαι ὄλεθρον compare Od.1. 166.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>304</strong>] δυνάμεσθά (imperf.) κεν is used here almost with the force of a pluperf.; so, sup. 211 'τότ᾽ ἂν οὔ τοι ἀποσχέσθαι φίλον ἦεν'. But there is a shade of difference between 'δυνάμεσθά κεν' and 'ἀπωλόμεθά κε' above; the former denoting an abiding condition, the latter a single fact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>308</strong>] κλυτὰ μῆλα, so in Soph. Aj.375'κλυτὰ αἰπόλια'. Eustath. is probably right in rendering 'κλυτά' as 'fine,' 'famous'—'ἢ διὰ τὸ πλῆθος, ἢ διὰ τὸ καλλίτριχον, ἢ διὰ τὴν πιότητα'—for there seems to be no authority for the use of 'κλυτός' in the sense of 'noisy,' which some attach to it, though there would be no difficulty in getting such a meaning from the root 'κλυ'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>314</strong>] ὡς εἰ is found with the optative in Il.2. 780; Od.10. 420; with the subjunctive in Il.9. 481; with the participle in Il.5. 374; 24.328.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ἐπιθείη, the subject to the verb is unexpressed, as in such phrases as 'τόσσον ἀπῆν ὅσσον τε γέγωνε βοήσας' inf. 473, 'ἀρξάμενοι τοῦ χώρου ὅθεν τέ περ οἰνοχοεύει' Od.21. 142, 'οὐδέ κεν ἔνθα τεόν γε μένος καὶ χεῖρας ὄνοιτο' Il.13. 287, 'ὡς δ᾽ ἐν ὀνείρῳ οὐ δύναται φεύγοντα διώκειν' Il.22. 199.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>315</strong>] πολλῇ ῥοίζῳ, 'with frequent whistle.' 'ῥοῖζος' (connected with 'ῥοῖβδος') is equivalent to the 'ψίττα' of Eur. Cycl.49; or 'σίττα', as in Theocr. 4. 46 'σίτθ᾽ ἁ Κυμαίθα ποτὶ τὸν λόφον'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>319</strong>] Κύκλωπος γάρ. Here γάρ merely forms the introduction to the main sentence, which begins with τοῦ μὲν ὅσον τ᾽ inf. 325. For a similar pause compare Il.2. 803, where the words 'πολλοὶ γὰρ κατὰ ἄστυ' lead up to 'τοῖσιν ἕκαστος ἀνὴρ σημαινέτω' in v. 805.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>320</strong>] τὸ μέν. This is repeated as 'τὸ μέν' in 321, and as 'τοῦ μέν' in 325 the repetition of μέν seeming to keep the attention alive to the preparatory circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ἔκταμεν (i. e. 'ἐξέταμε') is used of felling trees, as 'αἴγειρον' Il.4. 486, 'νήιον' Il.3. 62.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>322</strong>] ὅσσον θ᾽ ἱστόν, cp. inf. 325 'ὅσον τ᾽ ὄργυιαν'. This is a brachylogical attraction for 'τόσσον εἶναι ὅσσος θ᾽ ἱστός ἐστι'. So in Od.10. 112'τὴν δὲ γυναῖκα'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'εὗρον ὅσην τ᾽ ὄρεος κορυφήν'. Compare also Od.11. 25.Milton has imitated this simile in his description of Satan's spear, 'To which the tallest pine, Hewn on Norwegian hills to be the mast Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is doubtful whether any limb of an olive could have been found long enough and straight enough to make such a staff for the Cyclops; and some have therefore proposed to read 'εἰλάτινον' for ἐλαΐνεον, but this would only introduce the new physical difficulty, that fresh pinewood blazes instead of smouldering or becoming charred in the fire. Cp. also inf. 394.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In ἐεικοσ-όροιο we have the root '-ερ', as in 'ἐρέσσω'. It more often appears as '-ηρ' as in 'τρι-ήρης'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>324</strong>] μῆκος and πάχος are accusatives qualifying 'τόσσον'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>325</strong>] ὄργυια^ (in Attic 'ὀργυια?') is from stem 'ὀρεγ'—seen in English 'reach.' It properly denotes the space between the finger-tips when the arms are 'extended.' The 'foot,' the 'cubit,' and the 'ell' are instances of measures derived from the human body. The 'fathom' is the same length as the 'ὄργυια', and is got at in the same way; but the word is applied to the length of line or thread (fead, faden) that can be held with the furthest stretch of the two arms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>326</strong>] ἀποξῦναι. With this reading (see crit. note) compare 'ἀκρέμων ἐλαίας … ὃν φασγάνῳ τῷδ̓ ἐξαποξύνας ἄκρον ἐς πῦρ καθήσω' Eur. Cycl.456. The Homeric picture is spoiled by the substitution of 'ἀκρέμων' for ῥόπαλον.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>327</strong>] ἐθόωσα, 'I sharpened it.' His men did the rougher part of the work, making the wood generally smooth and taper, while Odysseus gives the shape of the point. If 'θοόω' come from the same 100t as 'θοός' and 'θέω', we must look for the point of contact in the idea of 'sharp,' which signifies 'quick' as well as 'pointed.' But 'θοόω' may belong to another root altogether. Eustath. says 'θοὸν καὶ ὀξὺ συνώνυμά εἰσι: θοὸν δέ, τὸ μὴ ἁπλῶς ταχύ, ἀλλὰ τὸ τμητικὸν ἐν τῷ ἄκρῳ, ὁμωνύμως ἔχει'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>330</strong>] κατὰ σπείους, 'adown the cave,' that is, from the mouth to the inmost part, so in Od.12. 93 we have 'κατὰ σπείους δέδυκεν'. See note on Od. 2.337.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If 'μεγάλ' [α'**] be the right meaning it must be taken adverbially with κέχυτο; but it seems an unnecessary addition to ἤλιθα πολλή. An easy change would be to write 'κατὰ σπείους μεγάλου κέχυτ᾽', or, with Ahrens, 'κατὰ σπεῖος κέχυτο μέγα. μεγάλα' is used twenty-seven times adverbially in Homer, and is almost invariably joined with verbs expressing sound, as 'ἰάχειν, κτυπεῖν, βρέμειν, στενάχειν, εὔχεσθαι, ἀπύειν', or 'κλάζειν'. There are only two exceptions to this usage, 'μεγάλ᾽ ἀσπίδας ἐστυφέλιξαν' Il.16. 774; and 'κραδίη μεγάλα στέρνοισι πατάσσει' Il.13. 282, where the tumultuous thumping of the heart contains a notion of sound no less than of movement. Such a consistent usage makes the employment of μεγάλα here very suspicious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>331</strong>] πεπαλάσθαι. Cp. Schol. on Il.7. 171'οὕτως Ἀρίσταρχος καὶ Ἡρωδιανὸς διὰ τοῦ ς . . οὐ διὰ τοῦ χ'. Similarly Schol. H. here and Eustath. 1631. 14. If the reading be right, it must be referred to 'παλάζομαι' or some such form of 'πάλλομαι', or if it be still taken from 'παλάσσω' we must notice the peculiarity in following a 'τ' rather than a 'κ' for the characteristic letter of the verb; cp. 'πεπάσμην' ( Il.24. 642) from 'πατέομαι'. Ahrens regards 'πεπαλάσθαι' as a reduplic. aor. from 'πάλλομαι' with the substitution of 'α' for 'ε'. Transl. 'I bade them cast lots among themselves.' 'πάλλειν' is used properly of the 'ψῆφοι' shaken in the helmet; here it is transferred per metonymiam to those who shake the pebbles. Cp. Soph. El.709'στάντες δ᾽ ἵν᾽ αὐτοὺς οἱ τεταγμένοι βραβῆς'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'κλήρους [κλήροις**] ἔπηλαν'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>332</strong>] ἐμοι σύν. For instances of σύν following its case see Od.13. 303; 14.296; 15.410.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>334</strong>] τοὺς ἄν κε. For this combination see on Od. 5.361. In this passage ἄν is taken up, as it were, by the pronoun, leaving 'κε' to qualify the verb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>καί adds an emphasis to ἤθελον = those whom I should have liked to choose, even if there had been no decision by lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>335</strong>] ἐλέγμην (al. 'ἐλέχθην'), 'I counted myself in.' Cp. 'λέκτο δ᾽ ἀριθμόν' Od.4. 451.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>338</strong>] ἔντοθεν. Rumpf's conjecture for 'ἔκτοθεν'. See on sup. 239.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>339</strong>] τι ὀισάμενος, 'having some foreboding,' or 'suspicion.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>346</strong>] κισσύβιον. In Eur. Cycl.383 we have 'σκύφος κισσοῦ', and in Hom. Od.14. 78'κισσύβιον' is used for a milking-pail. In Theocr. 1. 27 it stands for a drinking-cup, and is called 'σκύφος', ib. 143; but the description Theocr. gives of the wreath of ivy carven round its lip seems to suggest the meaning of 'decorated with ivy,' rather 'than made of ivy wood.' Fritzsche, on Theocr. 1, states that 'κισσοῦβι' is a common name for a milking-pail at the present day in the Ionian islands: and he quotes from AmpeliusHom. Od., 8. 13'Sami in templo Iunonis est scyphus factus ex hedera.' On the whole we may suppose that ivy-wood was originally the material that gave its name to 'κισσύβιον', but that afterwards 'κισσύβιον' was used generally for a wooden cup or bowl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>349</strong>] σοὶ … λοιβήν. Eustath. describes the expression as 'κολακευτικόν, εἴ γε οὐχ ὡς ξείνῳ δῶρον ἀλλ᾽ ὡς θεῷ λοιβήν φησι τὸν οἶνον προσφέρειν'. Others explain it to refer to the hope of receiving hospitality, as though Odysseus would say, 'I brought the wine that I might use it to pour a libation with, when I should be entertained at thy hospitable board.' But the commencement of the sentence with the emphatic σοί is decisive in favour of the former interpretation. The grosser the flattery the deeper the irony: but, doubtless, it was not too strong for a savage who had described himself as superior to the 'μάκαρες θεοί'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>εἴ μ᾽ ἐλεήσας … πέμψειας, 'in the hope that thou mightest pity me and send me home.' For such a use of 'εἰ' see on sup. 229.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>352</strong>] ἀνθρώπων πολέων, 'of the multitudes of men.' The force in πολέων is, that the more numerous men are, the greater chance there is of a visitor to the Cyclops: but how many soever there may be, such an inhospitable reception of Odysseus will keep all others at a distance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>353</strong>] ἥσατο, from 'ἥδεσθαι'. The aorist commonly in use is 'ἥσθην'. The use of αἰνῶς is not confined to expressions of horror; but it is used with such verbs as 'φιλεῖν, ἐοικέναι, τέρπεσθαι'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>357</strong>] καὶ γάρ. The 'καί' emphasises 'Κυκλώπεσσι'. 'They know what good wine is, but this is something quite out of the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>359</strong>] For the use of τόδε after 'οἶνος' see note on Od. 12.75.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ἀπορρώξ. Properly a part broken off from another, used in Homer of a stream which is a 'branch' of the Styx, Il.2. 755; Od.10. 514.The adjective 'ἀπορρῶγες', 'abrupt,' is found as an epithet of 'ἀκταί' in Od.13. 98.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>362</strong>] Join περὶ … ἤλυθεν, and take Κύκλωπα as the direct object of the compound verb, and φρένας as the epexegetical accusative of nearer definition. Cp. Il.10. 139'τὸν δ᾽ αἶψα περὶ φρένας ἤλυθ᾽ ἰωή'. Euripides uses a similar expression 'ἕως ἐθέρμην̓ αὐτὸν ἀμφιβᾶσα φλὸξ οἴνου' (Alc. 758).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>366</strong>] ὄνομα_. The hiatus and lengthening of the final syllable depend mainly on the pause in the sense. But cp. inf. 392; Il.5. 576; 8.556. The form Οὖτιν is intentionally made different from the ordinary accusative from 'οὔτις', because it is used as a proper name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>369</strong>] πύματον … μετὰ οἷς ἑτάροισι. This is not equivalent to 'last, after his companions,' but rather 'last, in the list of his companions,' the regular use of μετά with dative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>372</strong>] ἀποδοχμώσας, 'drooping' His head droops over towards one shoulder. Schol. 'πλαγιώσας'. Cp. Virg. Aen.3. 631'Cervicem inflexam posuit, iacuitque per antrum immensus, saniem eructans ac frusta cruento per somnum commixta mero.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>374</strong>] ὁ δ᾽ ἐρεύγετο. A paratactic clause, giving the reason for this voiding of ἀνδρόμεα κρέα. In Eur. Cycl.591 Odysseus says, ' τῷ δ᾽ ὕπνῳ παρειμένος τάχ᾽ ἐξ ἀναιδοῦς φάρυγος ὠθήσει κρέα.'</p>

<li>
<p>[<strong>375</strong>] ὑπὸ σποδοῦ ἤλασα, 'I drave it under the ashes.' For this use of ὑπό with genitive compare 'ἐτέθαπτο ὑπὸ χθονός' Od.11. 52, 'ὑπ᾽ ἀνθερεῶνος τέτατο ὀχεύς' Il.3. 372.Cp. Od.5. 346 Od., 373.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>377</strong>] ἀναδύη. Editions previous to Bekk. generally concurred in writing 'ἀναδύῃ'. But 'ἀναδύη' is for 'ἀναδυίη' as 'δύη' in Od.18. 348; 20. 286: similarly we have 'ἐκδῦμεν' in Il.16. 99 for the optative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>379</strong>] ἅψεσθαι, 'to catch.' The middle voice gives a sort of animation to the expression, the passive is elsewhere found, as 'ἅφθη τὸ λήιον' Hdt.1. 19, 'ἁφθεὶς ὁ νηὸς κατεκαύθη' Thuc.4. 100.Here however the stake was not consumed, but only glowed with red heat; so we have 'διαφανής' and 'διάπυρος' to express 'red-hot.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>383</strong>] The common reading ἀερθείς merely reproduces the same notion that is already in ἐφύπερθεν, that he stands above it as a shipwright stands on a balk of timber and uses the drill to make a hole in the wood at his feet. But the reading of two important MSS. is ἐρεισθείς, which is said to have been preferred by Aristarchus. This would signify 'throwing my weight upon it,' as a man presses with his body upon the stock of a drill as it turns round. Transl. 'just as when a man bores shiptimber with a borer, while his mates at the lower end keep it spinning with a strap which they hold at either end; and the drill runs continuously.' The ἱμάς here serves the same purpose as the string of the 'bow,' used in working an ordinary drill. The strap made one turn round the shaft or barrel of the borer, so that by pulling at each end of it alternately the borer was made to revolve a turn or two, first in one direction and then in another. We are not, of course, to suppose that there was any such apparatus attached to this μοχλός, the particulars belonging to the simile of the 'τρύπανον' only. What Odysseus means to say is, that the work they were engaged in, and their various attitudes, resembled those of a shipcarpenter and his men using the drill. Euripides copies it exactly, 'ναυπηγίαν δ᾽ ὡς εἴ τις ἁρμόζων ἀνὴρ διπλοῖν χαλινοῖν τρύπανον κωπηλατεῖ' Cycl.460. Itis usual to describe τρυπῷ as a form of the optative, viz. contracted from 'τρυπάοι' ('τρυπάω'). Itmust however be remarked that ὡς ὅτε is nowhere else used in a simile with the optative; which mood is always introduced under such circumstances by 'ὡς εἰ'. Either then we must treat 'τρυπῷ' as a peculiar usage, or else accept the reading of Draco (de Metr. 86.26), 'τρυπᾷ'. Ameis proposes the participle 'τρυπῶν', and supplies, from the foregoing words, 'ἐρεισθεὶς δινεῖ' to complete the sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>387</strong>] ἑλόντες goes directly with δινέομεν, 'clavum arreptum torquebamus.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>388</strong>] The reading 'ἰόντα', which would make θερμόν agree with αἷμα, though accepted by Nitzsch and Bekk., is merely a conjecture. Nitzsch indeed compares Il.3. 61, where 'εἶσιν' is used of an axe: but 'εἶσιν διὰ δουρός', 'makes its way through a plank,' gives no analogy to the use of 'ἰόντα', absolutely, to signify rotatory motion; though 'νηὸς ἰούσης' might be quoted as an instance of 'ἰέναι' used of motion in general. Nitzsch characterises θερμὸν ἐόντα as meaningless (nichtig); but, surely, it is quite the reverse; for the especial thought is the intense heat of the end of the stake, which was so hot as actually to hiss, when plunged in the blood and juices of the eyeball.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>389</strong>] ἀμφί is to be taken adverbially with εὗσεν, 'round about,' as in Od.3. 429'ἕδρας τε ξύλα τ᾽ ἀμφὶ καὶ ἀγλαὸν οἰσέμεν ὕδωρ. εὕω' and Lat. 'uro' both belong to Skt. root uS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>392</strong>] ἰάχοντα agrees in gender with πέλεκυν only, ἠὲ σκέπαρνον being thrown in, as it were, parenthetically. μεγάλα lengthens its final syllable in arsis before 'ϝιάχοντα', but, inf. 395, we have 'περὶ δ᾽ ἴαχε', where the initial 'ϝ' is dropped. The usage seems to be that where the participle is used, it almost invariably has the 'ϝ' as in Od.4. 454; 10.323; 22.81; Il.11. 463(though in Il.21. 341 we find 'ἐγὼν ἰάχουσα'), and in the finite sense where 'ι^' is lengthened by the augment, the 'ϝ' is dropped, as 'μέγα δ᾽ ἴαχε' Il.23. 216, 'ὅτε τ᾽ ἴαχε' Il.18. 219, 'μέγ᾽ ἴαχον' Il.2. 333, 'μεγάλ᾽ ἴαχε' Od.2. 428.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>393</strong>] τὸ γάρ, sc. 'φαρμάσσειν'. Here, the hot bar answers to the iron, and the water to the eye. With 'βάπτειν' compare 'βαφῇ σίδηρος ὥς' Soph. Aj.651.The word 'βαφή' was afterwards used in the sense of 'temper;' as 'βαφὴν ἀφιᾶσιν ὥσπερ ὁ σίδηρος εἰρήνην ἄγοντες' Aristot. Pol. 4 (7). 14. The emphatic antithesis suggested by 'τὸ γὰρ αὖτε σιδήρου γε κράτος ἐστίν' seems to imply that while iron is vastly strengthened by such 'tempering,' the Cyclops' eye was destroyed by the corresponding process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>398</strong>] Join χερσὶν ἀλύων, to describe the wild movements of his hands in his agony. Elsewhere 'ἀλύειν' has 'υ^', so that some of the grammarians proposed to read here 'ἀλυίων'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>402</strong>] ἱστάμενοι. 'And taking their stand round the cave they asked what ailed him, 'What is this great hurt of thine, Polyphemus, that thou hast thus cried out?'' τίπτε τόσον is thus best joined with ἀρημένος, and ὧδε with ἐβόησας.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>408</strong>] οὐδὲ βίηφιν. The ambiguity in the word Οὖτις involves a similar ambiguity in οὐδέ. The Cyclopes understand the words to mean, 'neither by craft nor by violence;' but Polyphemus intended to signify, 'he is slaying me by craft, and not by violence.' The ambiguity might be rendered thus, 'It is no man's craft, no violence that is murdering me.' The Cyclopes regard Οὖτις as equivalent to 'οὔ τις', as may be seen by their quoting it in the form 'μή τις' in v. 410. It is difficult not to suppose that a pun is intended between 'μή τίς σε βιάζεται' and 'μῆτις ἀμύμων', for the Cyclops has been over-reached by the 'μῆτις' of the 'οὔτις' or 'Οὖτις'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>410</strong>] οἶον ἐόντα, that is, 'defenceless in having no neighbours to help you.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>411</strong>] νοῦσον ἀλέασθαι. See on Od. 5.394 for the views of the ancients about diseases; and for the general sentiment cp. Od.16. 447'θεόθεν δ᾽ οὐκ ἔστ᾽ ἀλέασθαι'. The genitive, Διός, expressing the source, is like 'ἀνέμων κῦμα' Od.13. 99.Their meaning probably was that they thought he had gone hopelessly mad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>415</strong>] ὠδίνων ὀδύνῃσι, 'in agonies of anguish.' Here the 'παρήχησις' is, of course, intentional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>416</strong>] ψηλαφάω, according to Döderl. from an adjectival form 'ψηλός' (from 'ψάω') and 'ἁφή' ('ἅπτω'). Curt. connects it with 'ψάλλω', root 'ψαλ', comparing Lat. palpare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>417</strong>] χεῖρε πετάσσας. Cp. 'ἐν πύλαισι γὰρ σταθεὶς φάραγγος τάσδ᾽ ἐναρμόσω χέρας' Eur. Cycl.668.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>419</strong>] Join οὕτω νήπιον, and take ἤλπετο with ἐνὶ φρεσί as 'ἔλπετο . . κατὰ θυμόν' Il.10. 355.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>420</strong>] ὅπως … γένοιτο, 'How all might be for the very best.' For the neuter plural 'ἄριστα' used as an abstract noun cp. 'οὐδέ ποτ᾽ ἶσα'
'ἔσσεται' Od.2. 203, 'οὐκέτι φυκτὰ πέλοντο' 8. 299.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>423</strong>] ὥς τε περὶ ψυχῆς = 'utpote de vita;' as we say, 'in a matter of life and death.' Cp. Il.22. 161.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>426</strong>] ἰοδνεφές. Eustath. rightly interprets this by 'μέλαν'. Ernesti endeavours to twist the word so as to mean 'white,' but quite unnecessarily; for while we have as epithets of sheep, 'λευκός' Il.3. 103, 'ἄργυφος' Od.10. 85, and 'ἀργεννός' Il.6. 424; we have also 'μέλας' in Od.10. 527; and 'παμμέλας' ib. 525.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>427</strong>] λύγοισι. This word properly denotes the pliant twigs of the agnus castus (Vitex agnus L.). Dioscorides, 1. 136, thus describes it: 'ἄγνος ἢ λύγος θάμνός ἐστι δενδρώδης παρὰ ποταμοῖς τραχέσι τε τόποις καὶ χαράδραις φυόμενος, ῥάβδους ἔχων δυσθραύστους μακράς: φύλλα δὲ ὥσπερ ἐλαίας, ἁπαλώτερα δέ: τὸ δ᾽ ἄνθος ἡ μέν τις λευκὸν σὺν ὑποπορφυρίζοντι, ἡ δὲ πορφυροῦν φέρει'. The profusion of scented flowers of the 'ἄγνος' is noticed in the opening scene of Plato's Phaedrus. With λύγοι Achilles binds two prisoners, Il.11. 105; and with the same Odysseus ties together the legs of the great stag which he had shot, Od.10. 166.The same sort of 'green withes' were used to bind Samson (Judges 16. 7). The stem 'λυγ', Lat. lig-are, appears in the Skt. liG. The tree is still called 'λυγειά' in Greece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>429</strong>] σύντρεις may be so written on the analogy of 'ξυνεείκοσι' Od.14. 98, or 'σύνδυο' h. Hom. Ven. 74. If we adopt, with some good MSS, 'σὺν τρεῖς αἰνύμενος' we must treat it as a tmesis, and may compare 'συναίνυτο' Il.21. 502.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>φόρεσκε. The iterative tense is used, because there were several successive groups of three.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>433</strong>] Join κατὰ with λαβών. 'Having grasped his back, I lay curled up under his shaggy belly.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Schol. interprets ἐλυσθείς by 'συστραφείς'. We find in Il.23. 393'ῥυμὸς δ᾽ ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἐλύσθη', where Schol. B. interprets by 'συνερύη'. In Il.24. 510'προπάροιθε ποδῶν Ἀχιλῆος ἐλυσθείς' is rendered by the same Schol. 'συνειλυθεὶς ἢ κυλισθείς'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It must be noticed that κείμην is an unusual word to express 'suspension.' But, after all, the posture is rightly described by 'κεῖσθαι', as Odysseus is outstretched back downwards. Nor is the impossibility of holding on all night to the sheep's wool to be considered for an instant. It is only the same scene that appears in the 'Romans de Dolopathos' (see Appendix 3), where the robber holds on to the hen-perch for a day and a night while the blinded giant is laying about him with his club. Otherwise we should have to accept the tame interpretation, that Odysseus lay nestling at the ram's side, while the creature slept—his hands interlaced in the fleece—and that when the ram rose to go out, he lifted Odysseus with him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>434</strong>] χερσίν is emphatic, because the men were tied by withes, but there is no one to tie Odysseus, so that his hands are all that he has wherewith to support himself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>435</strong>] It is better to join νωλεμέως with ἐχόμην, as in Od.12. 437, and, similarly, Od.20. 24.νωλεμέως is a word of unknown etymology. But however the meaning may come, there seems no doubt that the general sense is 'firmly' or 'constantly.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>στρεφθείς is generally rendered 'twisted in,' i. e. with hands interlaced with the wool. But no analogy is found to support this use of στρεφθείς, which commonly means 'turning round' or 'back;' cp. Il.5. 575; 15.645; 16.598. Düntzer would interpret it here 'turned round,' meaning that the head of Odysseus peered out at one side. But it is more likely that it means only 'turned round,' i. e. hanging downwards; just as in Od.12. 432 foll. Odysseus clings to the fig-tree, and holds on 'ὡς νυκτερίς'. Translate, 'And, turning myself over, I firmly gripped his thick wool with my hands.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>443</strong>] ὥς οἱ. For this some write 'ὡς' 'οἵ', which Nitzsch approves. But 'οἱ' is not the nominative plural, referring to the comrades of Odysseus, but a dative referring to the Cyclops. It is a true dativus ethicus, and is nearly equivalent in force to 'all unbeknown to him.' The enclitic, in this reading, throws back its accent on 'ὡς'. See note on sup. 42 'μή τίς μοι ἀτεμβόμενος κίοι ἴσης'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>445</strong>] λάχνῳ στεινόμενος, 'cumbered by his wool and me,' that is, 'by me sticking to his wool,' for the weight of the wool itself does not properly enter into the description. Thus we may take λάχνῳ καὶ ἐμοί as a species of hendiadys; cp. Od.19. 396'κλεπτοσύνῃ θ᾽ ὅρκῳ τε'. But the particular combination is no doubt chosen to give a comic touch to the whole. The unexpected addition of ἐμοί after λάχνῳ would be described in later Greek as a true 'σκῶμμα παρὰ προσδοκίαν'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>447</strong>] Κριὲ πέπον. The word used for 'ram' in the Iliad is 'κτίλος, κριός' is probably connected with 'κέρας'. Eustath. remarks that we are reminded by this scene of Hector ( Il.8. 185), Achilles ( Il.19. 400), and Antilochus ( Il.23. 402) talking with their horses. Cicero ( Disp. Tusc.5. 115） fails to understand this natural craving on the part of the Cyclops for sympathy in his distress even from an animal, and notes how 'Polyphemum Homerus cum immanem ferumque finxisset, cum ariete etiam colloquentem facit, eiusque laudare fortunas, quod qua vellet ingredi posset, et quae vellet attingere. Recte hic quidem. Nihilo enim erat ipse Cyclops quam aries ille prudentior.' But Cicero's entire description of the scene is so unlike the Homeric picture, that we must either suppose that he had forgotten the original, or that he was confusing the story in Homer with the later account, perhaps, of some tragedian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>448</strong>] λελειμμένος … οἰῶν, 'distanced by the sheep.' Compare 'τόσσον δὴ Μενέλαος ἀμύμονος Ἀντιλόχοιο'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'λείπετο' Il.23. 523. So too, 'κίρκοι πελειῶν οὐ μακρὰν λελειμμένοι' Aesch. P. V.857. With the use of the present tense ἔρχεαι after πάρος cp. 'πάρος πώλεαι' Od.4. 811, and 5. 88.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>450</strong>] μακρὰ βιβάς. This graphically describes the proud bearing generally noticeable in the animal that is the leader of a herd or flock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>451</strong>] ἀπονέεσθαι. For the lengthening of the initial 'α_' see note on Od. 12.423.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>455</strong>] πεφυγμένον εἶναι ὄλεθρον. See note on Od. 1.20.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>456</strong>] εἰ δὴ ὁμοφρονέοις, 'couldest thou feel as I do, and get the gift of speech, so as to tell me where that man is skulking from my wrath, then should his brain, as he was smitten, be dashed all abroad on the ground, and my heart should be eased from the trouble which good-for-nothing No-man gave me.' There is a grim sort of reference in πόρεν to the word that was used, sup. 360, of Odysseus handing the wine to the Cyclops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ποτιφωνήεις is a word the composition of which suggests a difficulty; the general rule being that Homeric adjectives in '-εις' are derived from nouns substantive, as 'ὀμφαλό-εις, αὐδή-εις'. There appears to be an exception to this general rule in 'ὀξυόεις', which seems to point to 'ὀξύς'. But we may follow Bekker in referring 'ὀξυόεις' to 'ὀξύα' or 'ὀξύη', and so make it equivalent to 'ὀξύινος'. But there is no synthetic compound of 'ποτί' and 'φωνή' from which 'ποτιφωνήεις' can be formed; and a similar irregularity appears in the words 'βαθυδινήεις', from 'βαθύς' and 'δίνη', or 'ἀμφιγυήεις', from 'ἀμφί' and 'γυῖον'. For other readings see crit. note.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>457</strong>] ἠλασκάζει is used, in Il.18. 281, in the intransitive sense of 'wandering.' Hermann would read 'ἠλυσκάζει' for 'ἀλυσκάζει'. But the two meanings meet in the no ion of 'dodging.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>459</strong>] For θεινομένου after οἱ see on Od. 6.157.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>462</strong>] 'ἐλθόντες . . λυόμην . . ὑπέλυσα'. The plural ἐλθόντες seems to prepare us for 'ἐλυόμεθα', instead of which two verbs are substituted as giving a more exact description. A similar use of a plural nominative subdivided into two singulars is found in Od.12. 73; 18.95; 24.483; Il.3. 211; 10.224.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>463</strong>] ὑπ᾽ ἀρνειοῦ='from under the sheep.' Cp. 'ὑπ᾽ ἀπήνης λύειν ἡμιόνους' Od.7. 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>464</strong>] ταναύποδα, i. e. 'ταναϝόποδα', the 'υ' representing the digamma. So we find 'αὔως' for 'ἀϝώς' ('ἠώς'), 'ἀυέρυσαν, καλαῦροψ', and, notably, 'ταλαύρινος'= 'ταλα-ύρινο-ς', i. e. 'ταλά-ϝρινο-ς'. See Curt. G. E. 496 foll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>δημός, 'fat,' is connected by Weber with 'δαίω', as if the sacrificial fat for burning: but against this meaning we have the fact that 'δημός' is used for the fat of human beings as well as of animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>465</strong>] περιτροπέοντες. On the analogy of 'περιτροπέων ἐνιαυτός' we might construe this 'oft turning round,' viz. to see if the Cyclops were in pursuit. We should certainly rather expect to find a middle voice used, like 'ἐντροπαλίζεσθαι' Il.6. 496; so that it is preferable to render περιτροπέοντες here 'driving in,' sc. into a compact flock, for the purpose of taking them down to the ship. Cp. 'βοῦς περιταμνόμενον' Od.11. 402; 24.112. Fäsi compares Apoll. Rhod. Arg. 2. 143 'ἤδη δ᾽ ἄσπετα μῆλα περιτροπάδην ἐτάμοντο'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'ἥρωες'. We find 'περιτροπέων' in the sense of 'deceiving' in h. Hom. Merc. 542.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>468</strong>] Join ἀνά-νεῦον, i. e. I signalled my refusal. The proper meaning of ἀνανεύειν is to express dissent or refusal by throwing back the head, opposed to 'κατανεύειν', the corresponding gesture of assent or permission by nodding and bowing the head. ἀνανεύειν may be used absolutely, or with 'καρήατι' Il.22. 205, or, as here, with ὀφρύσι, the expression of disapprobation being also exhibited in the knitting of the brow or closing of the eyes: cp. Ar. Lysist.126'τί μοι μυᾶτε κἀνανεύετε';</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>469</strong>] κλαίειν is directly governed by οὐκ εἴων, the words ἀνά … ἑκάστῳ being parenthetical, as 'οὐδ᾽ ἀπέλειπεν' sup. 292.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>470</strong>] βαλόντας. A hasty action suggestive of hurry. In Od.11. 4, where there is no such haste implied, we have the more deliberate 'ἐν δὲ τὰ μῆλα λαβόντες ἐβήσαμεν'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>474</strong>] κερτομίοισι ('κείρω') is used here and in Il.1. 539 as a substantive; cp. 'μειλιχίοισιν' Il.4. 256, and 'ὀνειδείοισιν' Il.22. 497.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>475</strong>] οὐκ ἄρ᾽ ἔμελλες. The negative attaches closely to ἀνάλκιδος, which is the emphatic word in the sentence. The words are equivalent to 'οὐκ ἄρα ἄναλκις ἦν ἀνὴρ οὗ ἑταίρους ἔδμεναι ἔμελλες', 'He was no weakling whose comrades thou wast minded to eat.' ἔμελλες refers back to v. 208, when the Cyclops first began his horrid butchery. ἄρα='as you see,' introducing the illustration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>477</strong>] καὶ λίην, 'to the very uttermost.' Cp. 'καὶ μάλα' Od.1. 318 etc., 'καὶ κάρτα' Soph. O. C.65.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>478</strong>] σῷ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, thereby specially violating the rites of hospitality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>483</strong>] τυτθὸν … ἱκέσθαι. This line cannot be read here, though it is appropriate enough in v. 540. A stone that fell προπάροιθε νεός would not go near the οἰήιον. Probably the missile passed clean over the ship and fell before her bows; as it appears, from v. 489 foll., that the stern was the part toward the shore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>485</strong>] τὴν δ᾽ αἶψ̓, 'and the backwashing wave carried her swiftly to land (a surge setting in from the sea), and drave her to approach the strand.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>παλιρρόθιον is here used of a wave that draws in to shore; in Od.5. 430 it is the under-tow of the surf that carries the swimmer out to sea. But the epithet is correct in both passages, for the wave 'carries back' to the place from which escape is being sought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>486</strong>] πλημυρίς ('πλήθω'), interpreted by Apollon. as 'ὅρμημα τῆς θαλάσσης', is not the flood-tide as distinguished from the ebb, but the swell from the fall of the stone, setting shoreward. It is a common expedient to bring a floating stick to the bank by throwing stones beyond the stick; and this was the effect of the great stone hurled by the Cyclops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>θέμωσε. Cp. Schol. V. 'ὁ μὲν Ἀρίσταρχος, ἤγγισε δὲ τῇ χέρσῳ: Καλλίστρατος δὲ ἀντὶ τοῦ ἐποίησε, παρὰ τὸ θεῖναι, παραγώγως. Ἄλλως. ἠνάγκασεν, ἐβιάσατο'. Schol. B. derives the word from 'θεσμός', i. e. 'ὁ νόμος καὶ ἡ ἀνάγκη', but, ultimately, the word must be referred to root 'θε' ('θεῖναι'). Cp. Eur. I. T.1396'εἰς δὲ γῆν πάλιν'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'κλύδων παλίρρους ἦγε ναῦν'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>488</strong>] ὦσα παρέξ. This means something more than pushed her 'off' or 'out;' it implies also the process of 'punting' the ship someway 'along' the shore. Perhaps the word 'away' might be general enough. If 'κοντός' (Lat. 'contus') be connected with 'κεντέω', it must be a pole sharp at the point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>489</strong>] ἐμβαλέειν κώπῃς. This is taken as the equivalent of the Lat. 'incumbere remis.' According to this rendering we have to supply some word like 'χεῖρας' or 'ἶνα', or else to treat ἐμβ. as a sort of reflexive verb, of which latter use we find no example in Homer. Perhaps we ought to interpret the phrase as meaning, 'to dash into [the sea**] with our oars,' comparing the dative with 'νηὶ κατηγαγόμεσθα' Od.10. 140, or 'χερσὶν ἀνασχομένω' Il.23. 686.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>490</strong>] κρατί, for no one dared to utter a sound while they were still within range of the Cyclops' missiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>491</strong>] δὶς τόσσον. This must mean twice as far as the distance given in sup. 473. The design of Odysseus is to row out of range; but the expression introduces an inconsistency, for to be out of range of shot must be to be out of hearing, if the first position (473) is described as ὅσσον τε γέγωνε βοήσας. But that they were not out of hearing is implied by the intention of Odysseus to address the giant, 'καὶ τότ̓ ἐγὼ Κ. προσηύδων', and we have no right to add to the picture by supposing that the Cyclops had come down to the water's edge, or was even wading in the sea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ἅλα πρήσσειν is analogous to 'κέλευθον πρήσσειν' Od.13. 83; the commoner construction being 'πρήσσειν ὁδοῖο' Od.3. 476.This usage is imitated in the later epicists, as 'κώπῃσι διέπρησσον μέλαν ὕδωρ' Quint. Smyrn. 14. 404.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>492</strong>] προσηύδων. The passage 491 501 seems to be parenthetical, and the 'προσηύδων' of 491 is resumed by the 'προσέφην' of 501. It does not seem according to Homeric usage to press a sense of attempted action into the imperf. 'προσηύδων'. Cp. Od.14. 485.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>496</strong>] φάμεν … ὀλέσθαι. With this use of the aorist after verbs of expectation or prediction see on 'φημὶ τελευτηθῆναι' Od.2. 171.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>497</strong>] φθέγγεσθαι expresses any shout or cry; αὐδᾶν is narrower, and implies the use of articulate words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>499</strong>] μαρμάρῳ, from root 'μαρ', as 'μαρμαίρω'. Seiler quotes from Montbel: ''Ici μάρμαρος et quelquefois πέτρος μάρμαρος (Il.16. 735) n'est autre chose qu'une pierre blanche comme nos cailloux ou brillante, comme la roche nommée mica.''</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>τόσσον γὰρ ἵησιν, 'so far he flings.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>501</strong>] ἄψορρον. See on sup. 282. He addresses him here 'again;' for his first address is given in v. 474.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>504</strong>] φάσθαι='dic.' Alluding to this passage, in which Odysseus reveals his name to the Cyclops, Aristotle ( Rhet.2. 3. 16) remarks that vengeance is incomplete till the guilty one knows for what cause and by whose hands it has been inflicted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>507</strong>] ἱκάνει, 'are come home to me;' so 'μόρος μιν ἱκάνοι' Il.18. 465. Cp. 'αἰαῖ: παλαιὸς χρησμὸς ἐκπεραίνεται: τυφλὴν γὰρ ὄψιν ἐκ σέθεν σχήσειν μ᾽ ἔφη, Τροίας ἀφορμηθέντος' Eur. Cycl.696.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>509</strong>] Τήλεμος. Cp. Theocr. 6. 23; and ''Telemus Eurymides, quem nulla fefellerat ales, terribilem Polyphemon adit: lumenque quod unum fronte geris media rapiet tibi, dixit, Ulixes.'' Ov. Metam. 13. 771</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>510</strong>] μαντευόμενος κατεγήρα. For 'μαντεία' was a regular profession, the 'μάντεις' being reckoned as public servants ('δημιοεργοί' Od.17. 383) along with the 'ἀοιδός, ἰητὴρ κακῶν', and 'τέκτων δούρων'. The 'μάντις' could interpret the present and predict the future either by the study of the flight of birds, or other augurial signs ('οἰωνοπόλος' Il.1. 69), or by dreams ('ὀνειροπόλος' Il.1. 63), or possibly by the smoke of the sacrifices, if this meaning can be got from 'θυοσκόος' Od.21. 145; Il.24. 221.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Κυκλώπεσσιν may be taken with μαντευόμενος='for the Cyclopes;' but its position in the line rather suggests that the meaning is local: he passed his life and reached old age among the Cyclopes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>512</strong>] χειρῶν ἐξ, 'that I should lose my sight at the hands of Odysseus.' Cp. 'φιληθῆναι ἐκ Διός' Il.2. 669.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This use of ἁμαρτάνειν is not found elsewhere in Homer, and Döderl. needlessly proposes 'ἀμερθήσεσθαι', from 'ἀμέρδειν'. The phrase is common enough in the Tragedians, as Eur. Alcest.342'τοιᾶσδ᾽ ἁμαρτάνοντι συζύγου'. The compound 'ἀφαμαρτάνειν' is used in Homer nearly in this sense, as 'σεῦ ἀφαμαρτούσῃ' Il.6. 411, 'φίλου ἀπὸ πατρὸς ἁμαρτών' Il.22. 505.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>515</strong>] ἄκικυς. In Od.11. 393 we find the substantive 'κῖκυς', which may belong to the same root as 'κῖνέω', and would then denote strength as exhibited in 'movement.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>518</strong>] πομπήν τ᾽ ὀτρύνω. These words make a sort of Homeric formula, as in Od.7. 151; 8.30; 11.357. It seems therefore better to take them closely together, and to regard δόμεναι κλυτὸν ἐννοσίγαιον as an epexegetic clause defining πομπήν. Similarly in Od.7. 151 we have 'αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ πομπὴν ὀτρύνετε— πατρίδ᾽ ἱκέσθαι θᾶσσον', 'hasten on with the preparations for my return—that I may reach home all the sooner.' So we may render here, 'and let me make speedy preparation for your return— that the famous Earthshaker may grant you one.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>523</strong>] αἲ γάρ. 'Would that I were able, having robbed thee of life and being, to send thee within the house of Hades, as certainly as Poseidon himself shall never heal thine eye!'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>525</strong>] With οὐκ … οὐδέ cp. Od.8. 176 Od., 280.For ὡς introducing an illustrative comparison into the expression of a wish cp. Od.17. 253'αἲ γὰρ Τηλέμαχον βάλοι ἀργυρότοξος Ἀπόλλων'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>. . 'ὡς Ὀδυσῆί γ᾽ ἀπώλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ'. The form is clearer when 'οὕτω' is introduced into the first clause, as 'εἰ γὰρ ἐγὼν οὕτω γε Διὸς παῖς αἰγιόχοιο' 'εἴην . . ὡς νῦν ἡμέρη ἥδε κακὸν φέρει Ἀργείοισι' Il.13. 825 foll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>527</strong>] χεῖῤ, i. e. 'χεῖρε'.
ἀστερόεντα is a good instance of a standing epithet, for the occurrences described here are taking place in the daytime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>535</strong>] νηὸς ἐπ᾽ ἀλλοτρίης, that is, the Phaeacian ship on board of which Odysseus was brought home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>εὕροι δ᾽ ἐν πήματα οἴκῳ. For this unusual position of the preposition see on Od. 6.167.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>538</strong>] ἧκ᾽ ἐπιδινήσας, 'he whirled it round and flung it, and put into it [sc. the effort**] vast strength.' Said of Ajax Il.7. 269.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For ἐπέρεισε compare Schol. L. 'β. συνεπέδωκεν ὅλον τὸ σῶμα τῇ βολῇ καὶ πάσῃ δυνάμει ἐχρήσατο'. The word is used without a direct object expressed in Il.5. 856'ἐπέρεισε εἰς κενεῶνα', the 'ἔγχος' may easily be supplied from the foregoing words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>539</strong>] There are two ways of punctuating here. We may either put a stop after τυτθόν, which will then qualify μετόπισθε, as 'τυτθὸν ὀπίσσω' Il.5. 443(Aristarch. ); or we may put a stop after κυανοπρῴροιο, so that τυτθόν may go with ἐδεύησεν, like 'τυτθὸν ἅμαρτε' Il.17. 609. In the latter case, δέ will stand as the third word in the sentence, which is only allowable when the first two words have a very close connection together. See crit. note on Od. 6.100. If then we join τυτθὸν ἐδεύησεν δέ we must treat 'τυτθόν' as making a sort of close combination with 'ἐδεύησεν', and this is the decision of Eustath. and the older commentators generally. The other way of punctuating is supported by Il.10. 345'παρεξελθεῖν πεδίοιο'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'τυτθόν', and Il.13. 184'ἠλεύατο χάλκεον ἔγχος' 'τυτθόν', in both of which passages a clause follows introduced by 'δέ'. This seems the preferable way. For the use of ἐδεύησε (='ἐδέϝησε') without any qualifying adverb Bekk. quotes Alciphr.3. 5. 3'ἐδέησα κινδύνῳ περιπεσεῖν'. Translate, 'And he threw it down a little astern of the dark-prowed ship, but he failed to reach the end of the steeringpaddle.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>540</strong>] οἰήιον ('οἴαξ') is properly the handle which turns the paddle or 'πηδάλιον'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>542</strong>] χέρσον. This describes the shore of the island mentioned in sup. 116: whereas 'χέρσος' in sup. 486 is the shore of the main land where the Cyclops lived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>543</strong>] ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε. The apodosis to this protasis is introduced by νῆα μέν in v. 546. So in Od.12. 1-5 'αὐτὰρ ἐπεί . . νῆα μέν', and Od.10. 508-511 'ἀλλ᾽ ὁπότ᾽ ἄν . . νῆα μέν'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>550</strong>] ἀρνειόν. That is the particular 'ram,' by means of which I had escaped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>553</strong>] ἐμπάζετο. Zeus refused to notice these offerings because the prayer of Polyphemus had been heard, and would be answered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
